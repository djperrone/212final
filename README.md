212 final project

project ideas

- chrome tracing visualization - chrome://tracing/
- python visualization from csv runtimes file
- pass by value vs reference visual
- machine learning - predict runtime of an algorithm based on data from our project
- compare large file searches vs smaller string searches
- use string class find function to compare correctness 
- for large test cases in order to benchmark algortithm search for a word/sentence in an entire doc or book
- find cost of search as input approaches infinity


Tentative Outline/Schedule

Rabin-Karp Algorithm (complete by 11/15)
    
    Date			- Comments on Progress
    11/10			- Completed solution to rbain-karp with limited test cases.
    		        	- We should figure out how to run a lot of test cases to find bugs.
			
    11/11                   	- Compared our solution to the find function built into the string class
                            	- and found a bug. Fixed the bug by doing modulus in the for loop of power function.
			    	- Update - Program can now read and search each line of a large text file.
			   	- Found bug when searching large textfile - rolling hash gives false positives
