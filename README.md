# CSC 212 Final Project

### Project Ideas

- chrome tracing visualization - chrome://tracing/
- python visualization from csv runtimes file
- pass by value vs reference visual
- machine learning - predict runtime of an algorithm based on data from our project
- compare large file searches vs smaller string searches
- use standard library find function to compare correctness 
- for large test cases in order to benchmark algortithm search for a word/sentence in an entire doc or book
- find cost of search as input approaches infinity

## Tentative Outline/Schedule

### Rabin-Karp Algorithm (complete by 11/15)

|Date|Comments|
|---|---|
| 11/10|- Completed solution to rabin-karp with limited test cases.<br>- Need to run a lot of test cases to find bugs.|
|11/11|- Compared our solution to the std library find function and found bug<br>-Fixed the bug by doing modulus in the for loop of power function.<br>- Update - Program can now read and search each line of a large text file.<br> - Found bug when searching large textfile - rolling hash gives false positives<br>-Fixed bug by increasing q and adding inner loop to check for false-positives<br> began testing timers in rk|

### Boyer Moore Algorithm (complete by 11/22)
|Date|Comments|
|---|---|
|11/11|- created a roadmap for the implemntation with a class and nessecary functions.<br> - Made substantial progress on understanding of the algorithm using an online visualization tool that steps through the algorithm for any example you type. Need more understanding of the good and bad suffix tables and preprocessing. <br> - will probably need to use a map to store the tables.
