“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in
other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the
only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.  The forms of
the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms.  Farewell,
Walton!  Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it
be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in
science and discoveries.  Yet why do I say this?  I have myself been
blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”

His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his
effort, he sank into silence.  About half an hour afterwards he
attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and
his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed
away from his lips.

Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this
glorious spirit?  What can I say that will enable you to understand the
depth of my sorrow?  All that I should express would be inadequate and
feeble.  My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
disappointment.  But I journey towards England, and I may there find
consolation.

I am interrupted.  What do these sounds portend?  It is midnight; the
breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.  Again there
is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin
where the remains of Frankenstein still lie.  I must arise and examine.
Good night, my sister.

Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the
remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail
it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this
final and wonderful catastrophe.

I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable
friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to
describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its
proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long
locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and
apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my
approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung
towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of
such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and
endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.
I called on him to stay.

He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the
lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and
every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some
uncontrollable passion.

“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my
crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its
close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it
avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee
by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer
me.”

His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to
me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his
enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I
approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his
face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I
attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster
continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I
gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.

“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you
had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse
before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,
Frankenstein would yet have lived.”

“And do you dream?” said the dæmon.  “Do you think that I was then
dead to agony and remorse?  He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,
“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh!  Not the
ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the
lingering detail of its execution.  A frightful selfishness hurried me
on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.  Think you that the
groans of Clerval were music to my ears?  My heart was fashioned to be
susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice
and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without
torture such as you cannot even imagine.

“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken
and overcome.  I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I
abhorred myself.  But when I discovered that he, the author at once of
my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for
happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me
he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the
indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter
indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance.  I
recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.  I
knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the
slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not
disobey.  Yet when she died!  Nay, then I was not miserable.  I had
cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my
despair.  Evil thenceforth became my good.  Urged thus far, I had no
choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly
chosen.  The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable
passion.  And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”

I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called
to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and
persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my
friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.
“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you
have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are
consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!
If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would
he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you
feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn
from your power.”

“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.
“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to
be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.
No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of
virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being
overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has
become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into
bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am
content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am
well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once
my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once
I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would
love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was
nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has
degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no
malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the
frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same
creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent
visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the
fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man
had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.

“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my
crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them
he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured
wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did
not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still
I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.  Was there no
injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all
humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his
friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic
who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous
and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an
abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my
blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.

“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and
the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to
death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have
devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and
admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that
irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but
your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the
hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the
imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands
will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.

“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work
is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to
consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,
but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this
sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me
thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall
collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its
remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would
create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the
agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet
unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no
more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no
longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,
feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my
happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first
opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the
rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to
me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by
crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in
death?

“Farewell!  I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these
eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive
and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better
satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou
didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;
and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think
and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than
that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to
thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my
wounds until death shall close them for ever.

“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I
shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning
miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and
exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration
will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit
will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.
Farewell.”

He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft
which lay close to the vessel.  He was soon borne away by the waves and
lost in darkness and distance.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

                                 A BOOK




                        A NIGHT AMONG THE HORSES


Toward dusk, in the Summer of the year, a man dressed in a frock coat
and top hat, and carrying a cane, crept through the underbrush bordering
the corral of the Buckler farm.

As he moved, small twigs snapped, fell and were silent. His knees were
green from wounded shrubbery and grass, and his outspread hands tore
unheeded plants. His wrists hurt him and he rested from time to time,
always caring for his hat and knotted yellow cane, blowing through his
moustache.

Dew had been falling, covering the twilight leaves like myriad faces
damp with the perspiration of the struggle for existence, and half a
mile away, standing out against the darkness of the night, a grove of
white birches shimmered like teeth in a skull.

He heard the creaking of a gate, and the splashing of late rain into the
depths of a dark cistern. His heart ached with the nearness of the
earth, the faint murmur of it moving upon itself, like a sleeper who
turns to throw an arm about a beloved.

A frog began moaning among the skunk cabbages, and John thrust his hand
deep into his bosom.

Something somnolent seemed to be here, and he wondered. It was like a
deep, heavy, yet soft prison where, without sin, one may suffer
intolerable punishment.

Presently he went on, feeling his way. He reached a high plank fence and
sensing it with his fingers, he lay down, resting his head against the
ground.

He was tired, he wanted to sleep, but he searched for his hat and cane
and straightened out his coat beneath him before he turned his eyes to
the stars.

And now he could not sleep, and wondered why he had thought of it;
something quick was moving the earth, it seemed to live, to shake with
sudden immensity.

He heard a dog barking, and the dim light from a farm window kept
winking as the trees swung against its square of light. The odor of
daisies came to him, and the assuring, powerful smell of the stables; he
opened his mouth and drew in his moustache.

A faint tumult had begun. A tremor ran under the length of his body and
trembled off into the earth like a shudder of joy—died down and repeated
itself. And presently he began to tremble, answering, throwing out his
hands, curling them up weakly, as if the earth were withholding
something precious, necessary.

His hat fell off, striking a log with a dull hollow sound, and he
pressed his red moustache against the grass, weeping.

Again he heard it, felt it; a hundred hoofs beat upon the earth and he
knew the horses had gone wild in the corral on the other side of the
fence, for animals greet the Summer, striking the earth, as friends
strike the back of friends. He knew, he understood; a hail to Summer, to
life, to death.

He drew himself against the bars, pressing his eyes under them, peering,
waiting.

He heard them coming up across the heavy turf, rounding the curve in the
Willow Road. He opened his eyes and closed them again. The soft menacing
sound deepened, as heat deepens, strikes through the skin into the very
flesh. Head on, with long legs rising, falling, rising again, striking
the ground insanely, like needles taking terrible, impossible and
purposeless stitches.

He saw their bellies, fawn-coloured, pitching from side to side,
flashing by, straining the fence, and he rose up on his feet and
silently, swiftly, fled on beside them.

Something delirious, hysterical, came over him and he fell. Blood
trickled into his eyes down from his forehead. It had a fine feeling for
a moment, like a mane, like that roan mare’s mane that had passed
him—red and long and splendid.

He lifted his hand, and closed his eyes once more, but the soft pounding
did not cease, though now, in his sitting position, it only jogged him
imperceptibly, as a child on a knee.

It seemed to him that he was smothering, and he felt along the side of
his face as he had done in youth when they had put a cap on him that was
too large. Twining green things, moist with earth-blood, crept over his
fingers, the hot, impatient leaves pressed in, and the green of the
matted grass was deathly thick. He had heard about the freeness of
nature, thought it was so, and it was not so.

A trailing ground pine had torn up small blades in its journey across
the hill, and a vine, wrist-thick, twisted about a pale oak, hideously,
gloriously, killing it, dragging it into dust.

A wax Patrick Pipe leaned against his neck, staring with black eyes, and
John opened his mouth, running his tongue across his lips, snapping it
off, sighing.

Move as he would, the grass was always under him, and the crackling of
last Autumn’s leaves and last Summer’s twigs—minute dead of the infinite
greatness—troubled him. Something portentous seemed connected with the
patient noises about him. An acorn dropped, striking a thin fine powder
out of a frail oak pod. He took it up, tossing it. He had never liked to
see things fall.

He sat up, with the dim thunder of the horses far off, but quickening
his heart.

He went over the scene he had with Freda Buckler, back there in the
house, the long quivering spears of pot-grass standing by the window as
she walked up and down, pulling at them, talking to him.

Small, with cunning fiery eyes and a pink and pointed chin. A daughter
of a mother who had known too many admirers in her youth; a woman with
an ample lap on which she held a Persian kitten or a trifle of fruit.
Bounty, avarice, desire, intelligence—both of them had always what they
wanted.

He blew down his moustache again thinking of Freda in her floating
yellow veil that he had called ridiculous. She had not been angry, he
was nothing but a stable boy then. It was the way with those small
intriguing women whose nostrils were made delicate through the pain of
many generations that they might quiver whenever they caught a whiff of
the stables.

“As near as they can get to the earth,” he had said, and was Freda
angry? She stroked his arm always softly, looking away, an inner
bitterness drawing down her mouth.

She said, walking up and down quickly, looking ridiculously small:

“I am always gentle, John”—frowning, trailing her veil, thrusting out
her chin.

He answered: “I liked it better where I was.”

“Horses,” she said showing sharp teeth, “are nothing for a man with your
bile—pot-boy—curry comber, smelling of saddle soap—lovely!” She
shrivelled up her nose, touching his arm: “Yes, but better things. I
will show you—you shall be a gentleman—fine clothes, you will like them,
they feel nice.” And laughing she turned on one high heel, sitting down.
“I like horses, they make people better; you are amusing, intelligent,
you will see——”

“A lackey!” he returned passionately, throwing up his arm. “What is
there in this for you, what are you trying to do to me? The
family—askance—perhaps—I don’t know.”

He sat down pondering. He was getting used to it, or thought he was, all
but his wordy remonstrances. He knew better when thinking of his horses,
realizing that when he should have married this small, unpleasant and
clever woman, he would know them no more.

It was a game between them, which was the shrewder, which would win out?
He? A boy of ill breeding, grown from the gutter, fancied by this woman
because he had called her ridiculous, or for some other reason that he
would never know. This kind of person never tells the truth, and this,
more than most things, troubled him. Was he a thing to be played with,
debased into something better than he was—than he knew?

Partly because he was proud of himself in the costume of a groom, partly
because he was timid, he desired to get away, to go back to the stables.
He walked up to the mirrors as if about to challenge them, peering in.
He knew he would look absurd, and then knew, with shame, that he looked
splendidly better than most of the gentlemen that Freda Buckler knew. He
hated himself. A man who had grown out of the city’s streets, a fine
common thing!

She saw him looking into the mirrors, one after the other, and drew her
mouth down. She got up, walking beside him in the end, between him and
them, taking his arm.

“You shall enter the army—you shall rise to General, or Lieutenant at
least—and there are horses there, and the sound of stirrups—with that
physique you will be happy—authority you know,” she said, shaking her
chin, smiling.

“Very well, but a common soldier——”

“As you like—afterward.”

“Afterward?”

“Very well, a common soldier.”

He sensed something strange in her voice, a sort of irony, and it took
the patience out of him:

“I have always been common, I could commit crimes, easily, gladly—I’d
like to!”

She looked away. “That’s natural,” she said faintly; “it’s an instinct
all strong men have——”

She knew what was troubling him, thwarted instincts, common beautiful
instincts that he was being robbed of. He wanted to do something final
to prove his lower order; caught himself making faces, idiot faces, and
she laughed.

“If only your ears stuck out, chin receded,” she said, “you might look
degenerate, common, but as it is——”

And he would creep away in hat, coat and with his cane, to peer at his
horses, never daring to go in near them. Sometimes, when he wanted to
weep, he would smear one glove with harness grease, but the other one he
held behind his back, pretending one was enough to prove his revolt.

She would torment him with vases, books, pictures, making a fool of him
gently, persistently, making him doubt by cruel means, the means of
objects he was not used to, eternally taking him out of his sphere.

“We have the best collection of miniatures,” she would say with one knee
on a low ottoman, bringing them out in her small palm.

“Here, look.”

He would put his hands behind him.

“She was a great woman—Lucrezia Borgia—do you know history——” She put it
back because he did not answer, letting his mind, a curious one, torment
itself.

“You love things very much, don’t you?” she would question, because she
knew that he had a passion for one thing only. She kept placing new
ladders beneath his feet, only to saw them off at the next rung, making
him nothing more than a nervous, irritable experiment. He was uneasy,
like one given food to smell and not to taste, and for a while he had
not wanted to taste, and then curiosity began, and he wanted to, and he
also wanted to escape, and he could do neither.

Well, after he had married her, what then? Satisfy her whim and where
would he be? He would be nothing, neither what he had been nor what
other people were. This seemed to him, at times, her wish—a sort of
place between lying down and standing up, a cramped position, a slow
death. A curious woman.

This same evening he had looked at her attentively for the first time.
Her hair was rather pretty, though too mousy, yet just in the nape of
the neck, where it met the lawn of the collar it was very attractive.
She walked well for a little woman, too.

Sometimes she would pretend to be lively, would run a little, catch
herself at it, as if she had not intended to do it, and calm down once
more, or creeping up to him, stroking his arm, talking to him, she would
walk beside him softly, slowly, that he might not step out, that he
would have to crawl across the carpet.

Once he had thought of trying her with honesty, with the truth of the
situation. Perhaps she would give him an honest answer, and he had
tried.

“Now, Miss Freda—just a word—what are you trying to do? What is it you
want? What is there in me that can interest you? I want you to tell me—I
want to know—I have got to ask someone, and I haven’t anyone to ask but
you.”

And for a moment she almost relented, only to discover that she could
not if she had wished. She did not know always what she meant herself.

“I’ll tell you,” she said, hoping that this, somehow, might lead her
into the truth, for herself, if not for him, but it did not, “you are a
little nervous, you will get used to it—you will even grow to like it.
Be patient. You will learn soon enough that there is nothing in the
world so agreeable as climbing, changing.”

“Well,” he said, trying to read her, “and then?”

“That’s all, you will regret the stables in the end—that’s all.” Her
nostrils quivered. A light came into her eyes, a desire to defy, to be
defied.

Then on this last night he had done something terrible, he had made a
blunder. There had been a party. The guests, a lot of them, were mostly
drunk, or touched with drink. And he, too, had too much. He remembered
having thrown his arms about a tall woman, gowned in black with loose
shoulder straps, dragging her through a dance. He had even sung a bit of
a song, madly, wildly, horribly. And suddenly he had been brought up
sharp by the fact that no one thought his behaviour strange, that no one
thought him presumptuous. Freda’s mother had not even moved or dropped
the kitten from her lap where it sat, its loud resolute purr shaking the
satin of her gown.

And he felt that Freda had got him where she wanted him, between two
rungs. Going directly up to her, he said:

“You are ridiculous!” and twirled his moustache, spitting into the
garden.

And he knew nothing about what happened until he found himself in the
shrubbery, crawling toward the corral, through the dusk and the dampness
of the leaves, carrying his cane, making sure of his hat, looking up at
the stars.

Now he knew why he had come. He was with his horses again. His eyes,
pressed against the bars, stared in. The black stallion in the lead had
been his special pet, a rough animal, but kindly, knowing. And here they
were once more, tearing up the grass, galloping about in the night like
a ball-room full of real people, people who wanted to do things, who did
what they wanted to do.

He began to crawl through the bars, slowly, deftly, and when half way
through he paused, thinking.

Presently he went on again, and drawing himself into the corral, his hat
and cane thrown in before him, he lay there mouth to the grass.

They were still running, but less madly; one of them had gone up the
Willow Road leading into a farther pasture, in a flare of dust, through
which it looked immense and faint.

On the top of the hill three or four of the horses were standing,
testing the weather. He would mount one, he would ride away, he would
escape. And his horses, the things he knew, would be his escape.

Bareback, he thought, would be like the days when he had taken what he
could from the rush of the streets, joy, exhilaration, life, and he was
not afraid. He wanted to stand up, to cry aloud.

And he saw ten or twelve of them rounding the curb, and he did stand up.

They did not seem to know him, did not seem to know what to make of him,
and he stared at them wondering. He did not think of his white shirt
front, his sudden arising, the darkness, their excitement. Surely they
would know, in a moment more.

Wheeling, flaring their wet nostrils, throwing up their manes, striking
the earth in a quandary, they came on, whinnied faintly, and he knew
what it was to be afraid.

He had never been afraid and he went down on his knees. With a new
horror in his heart he damned them. He turned his eyes up, but he could
not open them. He thought rapidly, calling on Freda in his heart,
speaking tenderly, promising.

A flare of heat passed his throat and descended into his bosom.

“I want to live. I can do it—damn it—I can do it! I can forge ahead,
make my mark.”

He forgot where he was for a moment and found new pleasure in this
spoken admission, this new rebellion. He moved with the faint shaking of
the earth, like a child on a woman’s lap.

The upraised hoofs of the first horse missed him, but the second did
not.

And presently the horses drew apart, nibbling here and there, switching
their tails, avoiding a patch of tall grass.




                          THREE FROM THE EARTH


  PERSONS:      │
    JAMES       │CARSON _brothers_
    HENRY       │                          〃
    JOHN        │                          〃

    KATE MORLEY—│_An adventuress, a lady of leisure_

  TIME—_Late afternoon_.

  PLACE—KATE MORLEY’S _boudoir. A long narrow room, with a great many
        lacquer screens in various shades of blue, a tastefully
        decorated room though rather extreme._

_At the rise of the curtain the three_ CARSON _brothers are discovered
sitting together on a couch to the left. They look like peasants of the
most obvious type. They are tall, rather heavy—and range in age from
nineteen to twenty-five. They have sandy, sun-bleached hair that insists
upon sticking straight up—oily, sweaty skins—large hanging lips and
small eyes on which a faint whitish down moves for lashes. They are_
_clumsy and ill clothed. Russet shoes are on all six feet. They each
wear a purple aster and each has on a tie of the super-stunning
variety—they have evidently done their best to be as one might say “well
dressed.”_

_When they speak—aside from their grunts—their voices are rough, nasal
and occasionally crack. They are stoop-shouldered and their hands are
excessively ugly._

_Yet in spite of all this, their eyes are intelligent, their smiles
gentle, melancholy, compassionate. And though they have a look of
formidable grossness and stupidity, there is, on second observation, a
something beneath all this in no way in keeping with this first
impression._

JOHN, _the youngest, and the smallest, looks around the room carefully_.


JOHN—A nice room, eh? [_He tries to whisper, but it comes forth buzzing
and harsh._]

JAMES—A woman’s room.

HENRY—How?

JAMES—A narrow room, John.

JOHN—Well?

JAMES—Cats and narrow walls.

HENRY—[_Grunting._] Ugh.

JOHN—Hush—I hear her coming! [_The curtains part and_ KATE MORLEY
_enters. She is a woman of about forty. Handsome. Dark. She_ _is
beautifully dressed—in a rather seductive fashion. She has a very
interesting head; she has an air of one used to adulation and the
pleasure of exerting her will. She has a trick of narrowing her eyes. As
she comes forward there is a general commotion among the brothers, but
none manages to stand up._]

KATE—Good day, gentlemen.

ALL THREE—Good day.

KATE—Nice of you to call on me. [_She seats herself, crossing her
legs._] You are the three Carsons, John, James and Henry, aren’t you? I
haven’t seen you for years, yet I think I should have known you.

ALL THREE—Ah ha.

KATE—Yes, I presume I should have known you. I have a good memory. Well,
as I said, it’s nice of you to come to see me. Social?

HENRY—You might call it that.

KATE—It’s quite nice to get an unexpected visitor or so. I’m the kind of
woman who knows just who is going to call on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday——

ALL THREE—Ah ha.

KATE—How’s the country?

JOHN—Just the same.

KATE—It always is.—Don’t you go mad—watching it?

HENRY—Now and again.

KATE—And how’s your father? [_Not pausing for an answer—almost to
herself._] I remember—_he_ was always mad. He used to wear a green cloth
suit, and he carried white rats all over his shoulders. [_Remembering
the three._] Ah, yes, your father—he was a barber, wasn’t he?

HENRY—No, a chemist.

KATE—[_Laughing uneasily._] I have a bad memory after all. Well, anyway,
in those days he had begun to be queer—everyone noticed it—even that
funny man who had those three flaxen-haired daughters with the thin
ankles who lives at the end of the street—— And your mother—a
prostitute, I believe.

HENRY—[_Calmly._] At times.

KATE—A dancing girl without a clean word in her vocabulary, or a whole
shirt to her name——

JAMES—But a woman with fancies.

KATE—[_Sarcastically._] And what ability?

HENRY—Oh, none, just a burning desire.

KATE—What’s the use of going into that? How did you get here—what for?

ALL THREE—On bicycles.

KATE—[_Bursting into laughter._] How exactly ridiculous and
appropriate—and what else?

JOHN—To see how the sun falls in a place like this.

KATE—[_Angrily, rising._] Well, you see, from left to right, and right
to left——

HENRY—True.

JOHN—[_Quietly._] And we wanted to see how you walked, and sat down, and
crossed your legs——

HENRY—And to get father’s letters.

KATE—Well, you see how I walk, sit down, cross my legs. What letters?

JAMES—Letters to you.

KATE—[_Uneasily._] So you know about that—well, and what would you
fellows do with them—read them to see how clever they are?

JAMES—No, we have the clever ones.

KATE—Mine?

JOHN _and_ HENRY—[_Nodding._] Exactly.

KATE—Oh!

JOHN—You suffer?

KATE—From time to time—there’s always a reaction.

HENRY—That’s vulgar, isn’t it?

KATE—Not unusually.

JOHN—The letters?

KATE—[_To herself._] Well, there is malice in me—what of it? We’ve all
been a while with the dogs, we don’t all learn to bark.

JOHN—Ah ha.

KATE—See here, what will you do with your father’s letters?

HENRY—Destroy them, perhaps.

KATE—And if I give them to you—will your father be as generous with
mine?

HENRY—Father is undoubtedly a gentleman—even at this moment.

KATE—Well, we shall see about that—first tell me how you live.

JOHN—We go down on the earth and find things, tear them up, shaking the
dirt off. [_Making motions to illustrate._] Then there are the cows to
be milked, the horses—a few—to be fed, shod and curried—do you wish me
to continue?

KATE—Yes, yes, go on.

HENRY—[_Taking the tale up._] We get up at dawn, and our father turns
over in bed and whispers: “If you meet anyone, say nothing; if you are
asked a question, look stupid——”

KATE—I believe you.

JAMES—And he says: “Go about your work as if you had neither sight,
speech nor hearing——”

KATE—Yes——

JOHN—And he adds: “If you should meet a woman in the road——”

KATE—[_Excited._] Then what?

HENRY—That’s enough. Then of a Sunday we watch the people going to
church, when we hear the “Amen,” we lift a little and sit back—and then
again——

KATE—Religion?

HENRY—Enough for our simple needs.

KATE—Poor sheep!

JAMES—Wise sheep!

KATE—What! Well perhaps. No one is any longer sure of anything. Then
what?

JOHN—When we come home he says: “What have you seen and heard today?” He
never asks, “What have you said?”

KATE—He trusts you?

JOHN—Undoubtedly. Sometimes we say, “We saw a hawk flying,” or, “A
badger passed,” and sometimes we bring him the best treat of all——

KATE—Well?

JOHN—Something dead.

KATE—Dead?

HENRY—Anything that has destroyed the crops—a mole—a field-mouse.

KATE—And never anything that’s harmless?

JOHN—Never.

KATE—Well, see here, I’ll give you those letters. Suddenly my heart says
to me, “Kate, give the oxen the rope, they won’t run away.”—Isn’t it so?
Very well, I put my hand on a certain package and all is over—I’m about
to be married, you know. [_She has risen and gone over to a little box
standing on the desk. Out from this she takes a package of letters tied
with a red ribbon. She turns and walks straight up to_ JOHN.] I’ll give
them to you. You are the youngest, the gentlest, and you have the nicest
hands. [_She sits down, breathing with difficulty._]

JOHN—[_Putting them into his blouse._] Thank you, Kate Morley.

KATE—Now, tell me about everything. How is that mother of yours? I
remember her—she was on the stage—she danced as they say, and she sang.
She had a pet monkey—fed it honey out of a jar kept full by her
admirers: grooms, stage hands, what not——

HENRY—Yes, and she used to draw pictures of it in the style of
Dürer—almost morbid—and later it caught a disease and died——

KATE—I don’t doubt it—and she, she had an under-lip like a balloon—and
your father kissed that mouth, was even tempted——

JAMES—My father often saw beyond the flesh.

KATE—Kissed such a creature!

HENRY—At such times she was beautiful.

KATE—[_With a touch of humility._] Yes, I’m sorry—I remember. Once I
passed her, and instead of saying something, something horrible—she
might—she looked down.

JOHN—She was beautiful, looking down.

KATE—[_Angry._] And I, I suppose I wasn’t beautiful to look at——

HENRY—No, I suppose not, that is, not for her.

KATE—[_Viciously._] Well, let me tell you, you haven’t inherited her
beauty. Look at your hands—thick, hard, ugly—and the life lines in them
like the life lines in the hands of every laborer digging sewers——

JOHN—There’s something in that, but they are just beginning.

KATE—[_Turning on them._] Look at you! You’re ugly, and clumsy, and
uncouth. You grunt and roar, you wear abominable clothes—and you have no
manners—and all because of your father, your mighty righteous and
original father. You don’t have to be like this. You needn’t have little
pigs’ eyes with bleached lashes, and thick hanging lips—and noses—but I
suppose you’ve got adenoids, and you may suffer from the fact that your
mother had a rupture, and in all probability you have the beginning of
ulcers of the stomach, for God knows your father couldn’t keep a meal
down like a gentleman!

HENRY—He _was_ delicate.

KATE—And why was he delicate? He called himself “The little Father,” as
one might say, “The great Emperor.” Well, to have a father to whom you
can go and say, “All is not as it should be”—that would have been
everything. But what could you say to him, and what had he to say to
you? Oh, we all have our pathetic moments of being at our best, but he
wasn’t satisfied with that, he wanted to be at it all the time. And the
result, the life of a mole. “Listen and say nothing.” Then he becomes
the gentleman farmer because he discovers he cannot be the Beloved Fool.
Suddenly he is the father of three creatures for all the world like
Russian peasants—without an idea, a subtlety—it’s wicked, that’s all,
wicked—and as for that, how do you know but that all three of you had a
different mother? Why, great God, I might be the mother of one of you!

JOHN—[_Significantly._] So I believe, madam.

KATE—[_Unheeding._] Do you think a man like your father had any right to
bring such children as you into the world—three columns of flesh without
one of the five senses! [_She suddenly buries her head in her hands._]

JOHN—[_Gently._] You loved our father.

HENRY—And you also had your pot of honey——

KATE—Thank God I had no ideals—I had a religion.

JOHN—Just what?

KATE—You wouldn’t understand.

HENRY—Shoes to the needy?

KATE—No, I’m not that kind, vicious boy.

JOHN—Are you quite certain?

KATE—I’ll admit all my candles are not burning for God. Well, then, blow
them out, still I’ll have a light burning somewhere, for all your great
breaths, you oxen!

HENRY—You were never a tower builded of ivory——

KATE—You’re too stupid to be bitter—your voices are too
undeveloped—you’d say “love” and “hate” the same way.

JAMES—True, we have been shut away from intonations.

KATE—You wouldn’t even wish to die.

JOHN—We shall learn.

KATE—Why bother?

John—[_Abruptly rising._] You have posed for the madonna?

KATE—Every woman has.

JOHN—You have done it better than most.

KATE—What do you mean?

JOHN—I looked at it when I came in. [_He picks up the photograph._]

KATE—Let it be—I was playing in the “Crown of Thorns,” an amateur
theatrical.

JOHN—Yes, I presumed it was amateur——

JAMES—You were a devoted mother?

KATE—I have no virtues.

HENRY—And vices?

KATE—Weak in one, weak in the other.

JOHN—However, the baby had nice hands——

KATE—[_Looking at him._] That is true.

JAMES—But then babies only use their hands to lift the breast, and
occasionally to stroke the cheek——

KATE—Or throw them up in despair—not a heavy career.

JOHN—And then?

KATE—[_In an entirely new tone._] Won’t you have tea?— But no, pay no
attention to me, that’s another of my nasty malicious tricks. Curse
life!

HENRY—Your life is drawing to a close.

JAMES—And from time to time you place your finger on a line of Nietzsche
or Schopenhauer, wondering: “How did he say it all in two lines?” Eh?

KATE—As you say, [_She looks at them slowly, one by one._] You are
strange things. [_Coming back._] But at least I’ve given up
something—look at your mother, what did she give up for your father—a
drunken husband——

JAMES—A drunken lover—that’s different.

KATE—I can’t help thinking of that great gross stomach of hers.

JAMES—Gross indeed, it won’t trouble him any more.

KATE—What’s that?

JOHN—He cut his throat with a knife——

KATE—Oh, my God! [_Pause._] How did he look?

JOHN—You can’t satisfy your æsthetic sense that way—he looked—well,
ugly, played out; yes, played out. Everything had been too much for
him—you—us—you could see that in the way he——

KATE—[_In a whisper._] Well, that’s strange—everything seems—I knew him,
you know. [_She begins to laugh._] And the dogs barked?

JAMES—So I believe.

KATE—[_Dazed._] And you, what are you three going to do?

HENRY—We are coming out of the country—we are going abroad—we can listen
there.

KATE—Abroad—listen—what are you saying?

HENRY—There are great men abroad.

JAMES—Anatole France, De Gourmont——

KATE—De Gourmont is dead.

JOHN—There will be others.

KATE—[_Still dully._] And how did you come to know such names—oh, your
father, of course——

JOHN—We needed them.

KATE—Strange, I’ve been prepared for every hour but this——

JAMES—Yet I dare say you’ve never cried out.

KATE—You are mistaken. I’ve cried: “To the evil of mind all is evil——”

HENRY—Ah ha, and what happened?

KATE—Sometimes I found myself on my knees——

JAMES—And sometimes?

KATE—That’s enough, haven’t we about cleared all the shavings out of the
carpenter shop?

HENRY—You at least will never kill yourself.

KATE—Not likely, I’ll probably die in bed with my slippers on—you see, I
have a pretty foot.

HENRY—We understand—you are about to be married.

KATE—To a supreme court judge—so I’m cleaning house.

JOHN—[_Standing with the photograph._] But it won’t be quite cleared out
until this goes. [_He takes it out of the frame and turning it over_
_reads._] “Little John, God bless him.” [_He turns it back._] God bless
him. Well, just for that I’d like to keep it.

KATE—That’s my affair.

JOHN—So I see. [_He puts the photo in his blouse with the letters._]

KATE—Well, perhaps—well, you’re not so stupid after all—— Come, for the
madonna give me back the letters—I’ll burn them I swear, and you can put
the madonna at the foot of the bed.

JOHN—I shan’t put it at the foot of the bed—I don’t look at the foot of
the bed——

HENRY _and_ JAMES—[_Rising._] And now we shall go.

KATE—[_Her hands to her head._] But, gentlemen, gentlemen——

HENRY—We won’t need to bother you again. We are leaving the country and
going elsewhere—and there was only one of us to whom you might have
shown a little generosity—in other words we do not wish to be reminded,
and now we can forget, and in time become quite hilarious——

KATE—But, gentlemen, gentlemen, not this way——

JOHN—Well? [_Quite suddenly he takes her in his arms, raises her face
and kisses her on the mouth._]

KATE—[_Crying out._] Not that way! Not that way!

JAMES—That’s the way you bore him!


                   [_The curtain drops behind them._]

[Illustration]




                               THE VALET


The fields about Louis-Georges’ house grew green in early Spring,
leaving the surrounding country in melancholy grey, for Louis-Georges
was the only man who sowed his ground to rye.

Louis-Georges was of small stature. His face was oblong, too pale. A dry
mouth lay crookedly beneath a nose ending in a slight bulb. His long
animal-like arms swung half a rhythm ahead of his legs.

He prided himself on his farming, though he knew nothing about it. He
surveyed the tender coming green with kindly good nature, his acres were
always a month ahead of his neighbours’.

Sometimes standing in the doorway, breathing through the thick hair in
his nostrils, stretching his gloves, he would look at the low-lying
sheds and the stables and the dull brown patches of ploughed earth, and
mutter, “Splendid, splendid!”

Finally he would stroll in among the cattle where, in dizzy circles,
large coloured flies swayed, emitting a soft insistent drone, like
taffeta rubbed against taffeta.

He liked to think that he knew a great deal about horses. He would look
solemnly at the trainer and discuss length of neck, thinness and shape
of flank by the hour, stroking the hocks of his pet racer. Sometimes he
would say to Vera Sovna: “There’s more real breeding in the rump of a
mare than in all the crowned heads of England.”

Sometimes he and Vera Sovna would play in the hay, and about the grain
bins. She in her long flounces, leaping in and out, screaming and
laughing, stamping her high heels, setting up a great commotion among
her ruffles.

Once Louis-Georges caught a rat, bare-handed, and with such skill that
it could not bite. He disguised his pride in showing it to her by
pretending that he had done so to inform her of the rodent menace to
Winter grain.

Vera Sovna was a tall creature with thin shoulders; she was always
shrugging them as if her shoulder-blades were heavy. She dressed in
black and laughed a good deal in a very high key.

She had been a great friend of Louis-Georges’ mother, but since her
death she had fallen into disrepute. It was hinted that she was
“something” to Louis-Georges; and when the townsfolk and neighbouring
landholders saw her enter the house they would not content themselves
until they saw her leave it.

If she came out holding her skirts crookedly above her thin ankles, they
would find the roofs of their mouths in sudden disapproval, while if she
walked slowly, dragging her dress, they would say: “See what a dust Vera
Sovna brings up in the driveway; she stamps as if she were a mare.”

If she knew anything of this feeling, she never showed it. She would
drive through the town and turn neither to right nor left until she
passed the markets with their bright yellow gourds and squashes, their
rosy apples and their splendid tomatoes, exhaling an odour of decaying
sunlight. On the rare occasions when Louis-Georges accompanied her, she
would cross her legs at the knee, leaning forward, pointing a finger at
him, shaking her head, laughing.

Sometimes she would go into the maids’ quarters to play with Leah’s
child, a little creature with weak legs and neck, who always thrust out
his stomach for her to pat.

The maids, Berthe and Leah, were well-built complacent women with serene
blue eyes, quite far apart, and good mouths in which fine teeth grew
gratefully and upon whom round ample busts flourished like plants. They
went about their work singing or chewing long green salad leaves.

In her youth Leah had done something for which she prayed at intervals.
Her memory was always taking her hastily away to kneel before the gaudy
wax Christ that hung on a beam in the barn. Resting her head against the
boards she would lift her work-worn hands, bosom-high, sighing, praying,
murmuring.

Or she would help Berthe with the milking, throwing her thick ankles
under the cow’s udders, bringing down a sudden fury of milk, shining and
splashing over her big clean knuckles, saying quietly, evenly:

“I think we will have rain before dawn.”

And her sister would answer: “Yes, before dawn.”

Leah would spend hours in the garden, her little one crawling after her,
leaving childish smears on the dusty leaves of the growing corn, digging
his hands into the vegetable tops, falling and pretending to have fallen
on purpose; grinning up at the sun foolishly until his eyes watered.

These two women and Louis-Georges’ valet, Vanka, made up the household,
saving occasional visits from Louis-Georges’ aunts, Myra and Ella.

This man Vanka was a mixture of Russian and Jew. He bit his nails,
talked of the revolution, moved clumsily.

His clothes fitted him badly, he pomaded his hair, which was reddish
yellow, pulled out the short hairs that tormented his throat, and from
beneath his white brows distributed a kindly intelligent look. The most
painful thing about him was his attempt to seem alert, his effort to
keep pace with his master.

Louis-Georges would say, “Well now, Vanka, what did they do to you in
Russia when you were a boy?”

“They shot my brother for a red,” Vanka would answer, pulling the hairs.
“They threw him into prison, and my sister took him his food. One day
our father was also arrested, then she took two dinner pails instead of
one. Once she heard a noise, it sounded like a shot, and our father
returned her one of the pails. They say he looked up at her like a man
who is gazed at over the shoulder.” He had told the tale often, adding:
“My sister became almost bald later on, yet she was a handsome woman;
the students used to come to her chambers to hear her talk.”

At such times Louis-Georges would excuse himself and shut himself up to
write, in a large and scrawling hand, letters to his aunts with some of
Vanka’s phrases in them.

Sometimes Vera Sovna would come in to watch him, lifting her ruffles,
raising her brows. Too, she would turn and look for a long time at Vanka
who returned her look with cold persistence, the way of a man who is
afraid, who does not approve, and yet who likes.

She would stand with her back to the fireplace, her high heels a little
apart, tapping the stretched silk of her skirt, saying:

“You will ruin your eyes,” adding: “Vanka, won’t you stop him?”

She seldom got answers to her remarks. Louis-Georges would continue,
grunting at her, to be sure, and smiling, but never lifting his eyes:
and as for Vanka he would stand there, catching the sheets of paper as
they were finished.

Finally Louis-Georges would push back his chair, saying: “Come, we will
have tea.”

In the end he fell into a slow illness. It attacked his limbs, he was
forced to walk with a cane. He complained of his heart, but he persisted
in going out to look at the horses, to the barn to amuse Vera Sovna,
swaying a little as he watched the slow-circling flies, sniffing the
pleasant odours of cow’s milk and dung.

He still had plans for the haying season, for his crops, but he gave
them over to his farm hands, who, left to themselves, wandered aimlessly
home at odd hours.

About six months later he took to his bed.

His aunts came, testing with their withered noses the smell of decaying
wood and paregoric, whispering that “he never used to get like this.”

Raising their ample shoulders to ease the little black velvet straps
that sunk into their flesh, they sat on either side of his bed.

They looked at each other in a pitifully surprised way. They had never
seen illness, and death but once—a suicide, and this they understood:
one has impulses, but not maladies.

They were afraid of meeting Vera Sovna. Their position was a difficult
one; having been on friendly terms while Louis-Georges’ mother lived,
they had nevertheless to maintain a certain dignity and reserve when the
very townsfolk had turned against her. Therefore they left her an hour
in the evening to herself. She would come creeping in, saying:

“Oh, my dear,” telling him long unheard stories about a week she had
spent in London. A curious week, full of near adventure, with amusing
tales of hotel keepers, nobility. And sometimes leaning close to him,
that he might hear, he saw that she was weeping.

But in spite of this and of his illness and the new quality in the air,
Vera Sovna was strangely gay.

During this illness the two girls served as nurses, changing the sheets,
turning him over, rubbing him with alcohol, bringing him his soup,
crossing themselves.

Vanka stood long hours by the bedside coughing. Sometimes he would fall
off into sleep, at others he would try to talk of the revolution.

Vera Sovna had taken to dining in the kitchen, a long bare room that
pleased her. From the window one could see the orchards and the pump and
the long slope down to the edge of the meadow. And the room was pleasant
to look upon. The table, like the earth itself, was simple and abundant.
It might have been a meadow that Leah and Berthe browsed in,
red-cheeked, gaining health, strength.

Great hams, smoked fowl with oddly taut legs hung from the beams, and
under these the girls moved as if there were some bond between them.

They accepted Vera Sovna’s company cheerfully, uncomplainingly, and when
she went away they cleared up her crumbs, thinking and talking of other
things, forgetting.

Nothing suffered on account of his illness. The household matters went
smoothly, the crops ripened, the haying season passed, and the sod in
the orchards sounded with the thud of ripe falling fruit. Louis-Georges
suffered alone, detached, as if he had never been. Even about Vera Sovna
there was a strange quiet brilliancy, the brilliancy of one who is about
to receive something. She caressed the medicine bottles, tended the
flowers.

Leah and Berthe were unperturbed, except from overwork; the face of
Vanka alone changed.

He bore the expression at once of a man in pain and of a man who is
about to come into peace. The flickering light in Louis-Georges’ face
cast its shadow on that of his valet.

Myra and Ella became gradually excited. They kept brushing imaginary
specks of dust from their shoulders and bodices, sending each other in
to observe him. They comforted themselves looking at him, pretending
each to the other that he was quite improved. It was not so much that
they were sorry to have him die, as it was that they were not prepared
to have him die.

When the doctor arrived they shifted their burden of worry. They bought
medicine with great relish, hurriedly. Finally to lessen the torment
they closed their eyes as they sat on either side of his bed, picturing
him already dead, laid out, hands crossed, that they might gain comfort
upon opening them, to find him still alive.

When they knew that he was really dying they could not keep from
touching him. They tried to cover him up in those parts that exposed too
plainly his illness: the thin throat, the damp pulsing spot in the neck.
They fondled his hands, driving doctor and nurse into a passion.

At last, in desperation, Myra knelt by his bed, touched his face,
stroked his cheeks, trying to break the monotonous calm of approaching
death.

Death did not seem to be anywhere in him saving in his face ... it
seemed to Myra that to drive it from his eyes would mean life. It was
then that she and her sister were locked out, to wander up and down the
hall, afraid to speak, afraid to weep, unless by that much they might
hasten his death.

When he finally died, they had the problem of Vera Sovna.

But they soon forgot her, trying to follow the orders left by the dead
man. Louis-Georges had been very careful to see to it that things should
go on growing; he had given many orders, planned new seasons, talked of
“next year,” knowing that he would not be there.

The hens cackled with splendid performances, the stables resounded with
the good spirits of the horses, the fields were all but shedding their
very life on the earth as Vanka moved noiselessly about, folding the
dead man’s clothes.

When the undertaker arrived Vanka would not let him touch the body. He
washed and dressed it to suit himself. It was he who laid Louis-Georges
in the shiny coffin, it was he who arranged the flowers, and he who
finally left the room on the flat of his whole noisy feet for the first
time in years. He went to his own room overlooking the garden.

He paced the room. It seemed to him that he had left something undone.
He had loved service and order; he did not know that he also loved
Louis-Georges, who made service necessary and order desirable.

This distressed him, he rubbed his hands, holding them close to his
mouth, as if by the sound of one hand passing over the other he might
learn some secret in the stoppage of sound.

Leah had made a scene, he thought of that. A small enough scene,
considering. She had brought her baby in, dropping him beside the body,
giving the flat-voiced: “Now you can play with him a minute.”

He had not interfered, the child had been too frightened to disturb the
cold excellence of Louis-Georges’ arrangement, and Leah had gone out
soon enough in stolid silence. He could hear them descending the steps,
her heavy slow tread followed by the quick uneven movements of the
child.

Vanka could hear the rustling of the trees in the garden, the call of an
owl from the barn; one of the mares whinnied and, stamping, fell off
into silence.

He opened the window. He thought he caught the sound of feet on the
pebbles that bordered the hydrangea bushes; a faint perfume, such as the
flounces of Vera Sovna exhaled, came to him. Irritated, he turned away,
when he heard her calling.

“Vanka, come, my foot is caught in the vine.”

Her face, with wide hanging lips, came above the sill, and the same
moment she jumped into the room.

They stood looking at each other. They had never been alone together
before. He did not know what to do.

She was a little dishevelled, twigs from the shrubbery clung to the
black flounces of her gown. She raised her thin shoulders once, twice,
and sighed.

She reached out her arm, whispering:

“Vanka.”

He moved away from her, staring at her.

“Vanka,” she repeated, and came close, leaning a little on him.

In a voice of command, she said simply, “You must tell me something.”

“I will tell you,” he answered, automatically.

“See, look at your hands——” She kissed them suddenly, dropping her wet
lips into the middle of the palms, making him start and shiver.

“Look at these eyes—ah, fortunate man,” she continued, “most fortunate
Vanka; he would let you touch him, close, near the heart, the skin. You
could know what he looked like, how he stood, how his ankle went into
his foot.” He ceased to hear her.

“And his shoulders, how they set. You dressed and undressed him, knew
him, all of him, for many years—you see, you understand? Tell me, tell
me what he was like!”

He turned to her. “I will tell you,” he said, “if you are still, if you
will sit down, if you are quiet.”

She sat down with another sigh, with a touch of her old gaiety; she
raised her eyes, watching him.

“His arms were too long, you could tell that—but beautiful, and his back
was thin, tapering—full of breeding——”




                              TO THE DOGS


  PERSONS:      │
    HELENA      │
  HUCKSTEPPE    │
    GHEID STORM—│_Her neighbour_

  TIME—_Late afternoon_.

  PLACE—_In the mountains of Cornwall-on-Hudson—the_ HUCKSTEPPE _house_.

  SCENE—_The inner room of the_ HUCKSTEPPE _cottage_.

_To the left, in the back wall, a large window overlooks a garden. Right
centre, a door leads off into a bedroom, and from the bedroom one may
see the woods of the mountain. The door is slightly open, showing a
glimpse of a tall mirror and the polished pole of a bed._

_In the right wall there is a fireplace._

_A dog lies across the threshold, asleep, head on paws._

_About this room there is perhaps just a little too much of a certain
kind of frail beauty of object. Crystal glasses, scent bottles, bowls of
an almost too perfect design, furniture that is too antiquely
beautiful._

HELENA HUCKSTEPPE, _a woman of about thirty-five, stands almost back
view to the audience, one arm lying along the mantel. She is rather
under medium in height. Her hair, which is dark and curling, is done
carefully about a small fine head. She is dressed in a dark, long gown,
a gown almost too faithful to the singular sadness of her body._

_At about the same moment as the curtain’s rising_, GHEID STORM _vaults
the window-sill. He is a man of few years, a well-to-do man of property,
brought up very carefully by upright women, the son of a conscientious
physician, the kind of man who commutes with an almost religious
fervour, and who keeps his wife and his lawns in the best possible trim,
without any particular personal pleasure._

GHEID _is tall, but much too honourable to be jaunty, he is decidedly
masculine. He walks deliberately, getting all the use possible out of
his boot-leather, his belt-strap and hat-bands._

_His face is one of those which, for fear of misuse, has not been used
at all._

HELENA HUCKSTEPPE _does not appear to be in the least astonished at his
mode of entrance._


GHEID STORM—As you never let me in at the door, I thought of the window.
[HELENA _remains silent_.] I hope I did not startle you. [_Pause._]
Women are better calm, that is, some kinds of calm——

HELENA—Yes?

GHEID—[_Noticing the dog, which has not stirred._] You’ve got funny
dogs, they don’t even bark. [_Pause._] I expected you’d set them on me;
however, perhaps that will come later——

HELENA—Perhaps.

STORM—Are you always going to treat me like this? For days I’ve watched
you walking with your dogs of an evening—that little black bullpup, and
then those three setters—you’ve fine ways with you Helena Hucksteppe,
though there are many tales of how you came by them——

HELENA—Yes?

STORM—Yes. [_Pause._] You know, you surprise me.

HELENA—Why? Because I do not set my dogs on you?

STORM—Something like that.

HELENA—I respect my dogs.

STORM—What does that mean?

HELENA—Had I a daughter, would I set her on every man?

STORM—[_Trying to laugh._] That’s meant for an insult, isn’t it? Well, I
like the little insulting women——

HELENA—You are a man of taste.

STORM—I respect you.

HELENA—What kind of a feeling is that?

STORM—A gentleman’s——

HELENA—I see.

STORM—People say of you: “She has a great many ways——”

HELENA—Yes?

STORM—[_Sitting on the edge of the table._] “But none of them simple.”

HELENA—Do they?

STORM—[_Without attempting to hide his admiration._] I’ve watched your
back: “There goes a fine woman, a fine silent woman; she wears long
skirts, but she knows how to move her feet without kicking up a dust—a
woman who can do that, drives a man mad.” In town there’s a story that
you come through once every Spring, driving a different man ahead of you
with a riding whip; another has it, that you come in the night——

HELENA—In other words, the starved women of the town are beginning to
eat.

STORM—[_Pause._] Well [_laughs_] I like you.

HELENA—I do not enjoy the spectacle of men ascending.

STORM—What are you trying to say?

HELENA—I’m saying it.

STORM—[_After an awkward pause._] Do—you wish me to—go away?

HELENA—You will go.

STORM—Why won’t you let me talk to you?

HELENA—Any man may accomplish anything he’s capable of.

STORM—Do you know how I feel about you?

HELENA—Perfectly.

STORM—I have heard many things about your—your past—— I believe none of
them——

HELENA—Quite right, why should you mix trades?

STORM—What do you mean by that?

HELENA—Why confuse incapability with accomplishment——

STORM—It’s strange to see a woman like you turning to the merely
bitter——

HELENA—I began beyond bitterness.

STORM—Why do you treat me this way?

HELENA—How would you have me treat you?

STORM—There was one night when you seemed to know, have you forgotten? A
storm was coming up, the clouds were rolling overhead—and you, you
yourself started it. You kissed me.

HELENA—You say it was about to storm?

STORM—Yes.

HELENA—It even looked like rain?

STORM—Yes.

HELENA—[_Quickly in a different voice._] It was a dark night, and I
ended it.

STORM—What have I done?

HELENA—You have neglected to make any beginning in the world—can I help
that?

STORM—I offer you a clean heart.

HELENA—Things which have known only one state, do not interest me.

STORM—Helena!

HELENA—Gheid Storm.

STORM—I have a son; I don’t know why I should tell you about him,
perhaps because I want to prove that I have lived, and perhaps not. My
son is a child, I am a man of few years and my son is like what I was at
his age. He is thin, I was thin; he is quiet, I was quiet; he has
delicate flesh, and I had also—well, then his mother died——

HELENA—The saddle comes down from the horse.

STORM—Well, she died——

HELENA—And that’s over.

STORM—Well, there it is, I have a son——

HELENA—And that’s not over. Do you resent that?

STORM—I don’t know, perhaps. Sometimes I say to myself when I’m sitting
by the fire alone—“You should have something to think of while sitting
here——”

HELENA—In other words, you’re living for the sake of your fire.

STORM—[_To himself._] Some day I shall be glad I knew you.

HELENA—You go rather fast.

STORM—Yes, I shall have you to think of.

HELENA—When the fire is hot, you’ll be glad to think of me?

STORM—Yes, all of us like to have a few things to tell to our children,
and I have always shown all that’s in my heart to my son.

HELENA—How horrible!

STORM—[_Startled._] Why?

HELENA—Would you show everything that made your heart?

STORM—I believe in frankness——

HELENA—[_With something like anger._] Well, some day your son will blow
his head off, to be rid of frankness, before his skin is tough.

STORM—You are not making anything easier.

HELENA—I’ve never been callous enough to make things easier.

STORM—You’re a queer woman——

HELENA—Yes, that does describe me.

STORM—[_Taking his leg off the table._] Do you really want to know why I
came? Because I need you——

HELENA—I’m not interested in corruption for the many.

STORM—[_Starting as if he had been struck._] By God!

HELENA—Nor in misplaced satisfactions——

STORM—By God, what a woman!

HELENA—Nor do I participate in liberations——

STORM—[_In a low voice._] I could hate you!

HELENA—I limit no man, feel what you can.

STORM—[_Taking a step toward her, the dog lifts its head._] If it were
not for those damned dogs of yours—I’d—I’d——

HELENA—Aristocracy of movement never made a dog bite——

STORM—That’s a—strange thing to say—just at this moment.

HELENA—Not for me.

STORM—[_Sulky._] Well, anyway, a cat may look at a King——

HELENA—Oh no, a cat may only look at what it sees.

STORM—Helena Hucksteppe.

HELENA—Yes.

STORM—I’m—attracted—to you.

HELENA—A magnet does not attract shavings.

STORM—[_With positive conviction._] I _could_ hate you.

HELENA—I choose my enemies.

STORM—[_Without warning, seizing her._] By God, at least I can kiss you!
[_He kisses her full on the mouth—she makes no resistance._]

HELENA—[_In a calm voice._] And this, I suppose, is what you call the
“great moment of human contact.”

STORM—[_Dropping his arms—turning pale._] What are you trying to do to
me?

HELENA—I’m doing it.

STORM—[_To himself._] Yet it was you that I wanted——

HELENA—Mongrels may not dig up buried treasure.

STORM—[_In a sudden rage._] You can bury your past as deep as you like,
but carrion will out!

HELENA—[_Softly._] And this is love.

STORM—[_His head in his arms._] Oh, God, God!

HELENA—And you who like the taste of new things, come to me?

STORM—[_In a lost voice._] Shall I have no joy?

HELENA—Joy? Oh, yes, of a kind.

STORM—And you—are angry with me?

HELENA—In the study of science, is the scientist angry when the fly
possesses no amusing phenomena?

STORM—I wanted—to know—you——

HELENA—I am conscious of your failure.

STORM—I wanted something—some sign——

HELENA—Must I, who have spent my whole life in being myself, go out of
my way to change some look in you?

STORM—That’s why you are so terrible, you have spent all your life on
yourself.

HELENA—Yes, men do resent that in women.

STORM—Yes, I suppose so. [_Pause._] I should have liked to talk
of—myself——

HELENA—You see I could not listen.

STORM—You are—intolerant.

HELENA—No—occupied——

STORM—You are probably—playing a game.

HELENA—[_With a gracious smile._] You will get some personal good out of
it, won’t you?

STORM—I’m uncomfortable——

HELENA—Uncomfortable!

STORM—[_Beginning to be really uncomfortable._] Who _are_ you?

HELENA—I am a woman, Gheid Storm, who is _not_ in need.

STORM—You’re horrible!

HELENA—Yes, that too.

STORM—But somewhere you’re vulnerable.

HELENA—Perhaps.

STORM—Only I don’t quite know the spot.

HELENA—Spot?

STORM—Something, somewhere, hidden——

HELENA—Hidden! [_She laughs._] _All_ of me is vulnerable.

STORM—[_Setting his teeth._] You tempt me.

HELENA—[_Wearily._] It’s not that kind.

STORM—I’ve lain awake thinking of you—many nights.

HELENA—That is too bad.

STORM—What is too bad?

HELENA—That you have had—fancies.

STORM—Why?

HELENA—Theft of much, makes much to return——

STORM—The world allows a man his own thoughts.

HELENA—Oh, no——

STORM—At least my thoughts are my own.

HELENA—Not one, so far.

STORM—What does that mean?

HELENA—You’ll know when you try to think them again.

STORM—You mean I’m not making headway—well, you’re right, I’m not——

HELENA—Now tell me what brought you through the window.

STORM—[_Relieved._] I’m glad you ask that, it’s the first human thing
that’s happened this afternoon.

HELENA—You have forgotten our great moment of human contact.

STORM—[_Nervously._] Well——

HELENA—You were about to tell me what brought you?

STORM—I don’t know—something no one speaks of—some great ease in your
back—the look of a great lover——

HELENA—So—you scented a great lover——

STORM—I am a man—and I love——

HELENA—What have you done for love, Gheid Storm?

STORM—I’ve—never gone to the dogs——

HELENA—So?

STORM—I’ve always respected women.

HELENA—In other words: taken the coals out of the fire with the
poker—continue——

STORM—That’s all.

HELENA—And you dared to come to me! [_Her entire manner has changed._]

STORM—No matter what you’ve been—done—I love you.

HELENA—Do not come so near. Only those who have helped to make such
death as mine may go a little way toward the ardours of that decay.

STORM—What have I done?

HELENA—You have dared to bring to a woman, who has known love, the
whinny of a pauper.

STORM—What am I?

HELENA—[_Softly, to herself._] How sensitively the handles cling to the
vase, how delicate is the flesh between the fingers.

STORM—I—I don’t know you.

HELENA—[_Dropping her hands to her sides._] Come here, Gheid
Storm—[_Gheid approaches slowly, like a sleep walker_]. Put your hand on
me. [_He does so as if in a dream._] So! [_She looks first at his hand,
then into his face, making it quite plain that he does not even know how
to touch a woman._] Yet you would be my lover, knowing not one touch
that is mine, nor one word that is mine. My house is for men who have
done their stumbling.

STORM—[_In an inaudible voice._] I am going now——

HELENA—I cannot touch new things, nor see beginnings.

STORM—Helena! Helena!

HELENA—Do not call my name. There are too many names that must be called
before mine.

STORM—Shall I die, and never have known you?

HELENA—Death, for you, will begin where my cradle started rocking——

STORM—Shall I have no love like yours?

HELENA—When I am an old woman, thinking of other things, you will,
perhaps, be kissing a woman like me——

STORM—[_Moving blindly toward the door._] Now I am going.

HELENA—[_In a quiet, level voice._] The fall is almost here.

STORM—Yes, it’s almost here.

HELENA—The leaves on the mountain road are turning yellow.

STORM—Yes, the leaves are turning.

HELENA—It’s late, your son will be waiting dinner for you.

STORM—Don’t take everything away.

HELENA—You will not even recall having seen me.

STORM—Can memory be taken too?

HELENA—Only that memory that goes past recollection may be kept.

STORM—[_At the door._] Good night——

HELENA—[_Smiling._] There is the window.

STORM—I could not lift my legs now.

HELENA—That’s a memory you may keep.

STORM—Good night.

HELENA—Good-bye, Gheid Storm, and as you go down the hill, will you lock
the gate, a dog thief passed in the night, taking my terrier with him.

STORM—The one with the brown spots?

HELENA—Yes.

STORM—That was a fine dog.

HELENA—Yes, she was a fine dog—restless.

STORM—They say any dog will follow any man who carries aniseed.

HELENA—Well, soon I return to the city.

STORM—You look tired.

HELENA—Yes, I am tired.

[_Gheid exits. Helena takes her old position, her back almost square to
the audience._]


                                CURTAIN

[Illustration]




                             BEYOND THE END


Behind two spanking horses, in the heat of noon, rode Julie Anspacher.
The air was full of the sound of windlasses and well water, where, from
cool abysses, heavy buckets arose; and, too, the air was full of the
perfect odour of small flowers. And Julie turned her head, gazing at the
familiar line of road that ran away into the still more familiar
distance.

The driver, a Scandinavian, who remembered one folk-tale involving a
partridge and one popular song involving a woman, sat stiffly on his box
holding the reins gently over the shining and sleek backs of the two
mares.

He began to whistle the popular song now, swinging a little on his
sturdy base, and drifting back with his tune came the tang of horse
skin, wet beneath tight leather.

The horses were taking the hill, straining and moving their ears, and
reaching the top, bounded forward in a whirl of dust. Still sitting
rigid, the driver clucked, snapping his whip, and began talking in a dry
deep bass.

“It’s some time since we have seen you, Mrs. Anspacher.”

Julie raised her thin long face from her collar and nodded.

“Yes,” she answered in a short voice, and frowned.

“Your husband has gathered in the corn already, and the orchards are
hanging heavy.”

“Are they?” she said, and tried to remember how many trees there were of
apple and of pear.

The driver took in another foot of reins, and turning slightly around,
so that he could look at her, said:

“It’s good to see you again, Mrs. Anspacher.”

She began to laugh. “Is it?” then with deliberation checked herself, and
fixed her angry eyes straight ahead of her.

The child, loose-limbed with excessive youth, who sat at her side,
lifted a small sharp face on which an aquiline nose perched with comic
boldness. She half held, half dropped an old-fashioned ermine muff, the
tails of which stuck out in all directions. She looked unhappy and
expectant.

“You remember Mrs. Berling?” he went on. “She is married again.”

“Is she?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

He began to tell her about the local office for outgoing mails, where a
nephew of her husband, Paytor, had taken a job.

The child sat so still that it was painful and Julie Anspacher moved
away, thinking aloud:

“All is corruption.”

The child started, and looked quickly away, as children will at
something that they expect but do not understand. The driver beat the
horses, until long lines of heavy froth appeared at the edges of the
harness.

“What did you say, ma’am?”

“Nothing—I said all is lost from the beginning—if we only saw
it—always.”

The child looked at her slowly, puzzled, and looked down.

“Ann,” said Julie Anspacher, suddenly lifting the muff over her hands,
“did you ever see two such big horses before?” The child turned its head
with brightness, and bending down tried to see between the driver’s
arms. Then she smiled.

“Are they yours?” she whispered.

Julie Anspacher took in a deep breath, stretching the silk of her waist
across her breasts. “No,” she answered, “they are not mine, but we have
two—bigger—blacker.”

“Can I see them?”

“Oh, yes, you shall see them. Don’t be ridiculous.”

The child shrank back into herself, clutching nervously at her muff.
Julie Anspacher returned to her reflections.


It was almost five years since she had been home. Five years before in
just such an Autumn the doctors had given her six months to live. One
lung gone and the other going. They called it sometimes the White Death,
and, sometimes, the love disease. She coughed a little, remembering, and
the child at her side coughed too in echo, and the driver, puckering his
forehead, reflected that Mrs. Anspacher was not cured.

She was thirty-nine—she should have died at thirty-four. In those five
years Paytor had seen her five times, coming in over fourteen hours of
the rails at Christmas. He cursed the doctors, called them fools.

The house appeared dull white between the locust trees, and the smoke,
the same lazy Autumn smoke, rose in a still column straight into the
obliterating day.

The driver reined in the horses until their foaming jaws struck against
their harness, and with a quick bound Julie Anspacher jumped the side of
the cart, the short modish tails of her jacket dancing above her hips.
She turned around and thrusting her black gloved hands under the child,
lifted her out. A dog barked. She began walking the ascent toward the
house.

A maid, in dust cap, put her head out of an upstairs window, clucked,
drew it in and slammed the sash, and Paytor, with slow and deliberate
steps, moved toward the figure of his wife and the child.

He was a man of middle height, with a close-cropped beard that ended in
a grey wedge on his chin. He was sturdy, a strong man, almost too
pompous, but with kindly blue eyes and a long thin mouth. As he walked
he threw his knees out, which gave him a rocking though substantial
gait. He was slightly surprised and raised the apricot-coloured veil
that covered the keen newness of her face, and leaning down kissed her
twice upon both cheeks.

“And where does the child come from?” he inquired, touching the little
girl’s chin.

“Come along, don’t be ridiculous!” Julie said impatiently, and swept on
toward the house.

He ran after her. “I’m glad to see you,” he went on, warmly, trying to
keep up with her rapid strides, that swung the child half off the
ground, stumbling, trotting.

“Tell me what the doctors said—cured?”

There was a note of happiness in his voice. “Not that I really give a
damn what they think, I always told you you would live to a ripe old
age, as they say. What did they do to Marie Bashkirtseff? Locked her up
in a dark room, shut all the windows—and of course she died—that was
their method then—and now it’s Koch’s tuberculin—all nonsense.”

“It worked well with some people,” she said, going ahead of him into the
living room. “There was one boy there—well—of that later. Will you have
someone put Ann to bed—the trip was bad for her. See how sleepy the
child is—run along, Ann,” she added, pushing her slightly but kindly
toward the maid. Then when they had disappeared, she stood looking about
her, drawing off her gloves.

“I’m glad you took down the crystals—I always hated them.”—She moved to
the windows.

“I didn’t, the roof fell in—just after my last visit in December. You’re
looking splendid, Julie.” He coloured. “I’m glad, you know—awfully glad.
I began to think—well, not that the doctors know anything,” he said,
laughing: “but it’s a drop here of about fifteen hundred feet, but your
heart is good—always was.”

“What do you know about my heart, Paytor?” Julie said, angrily. “You
don’t know what you are talking about at all. The child——”

“Well, yes——?”

“Her name is Ann,” she finished sulkily.

“It’s a sweet name—it was your mother’s, too. Whose is she?”

“Oh, good heavens!” Julie cried, moving around the room. “Mine, mine,
mine, of course, whose would she be if not mine?”

He looked at her. “Yours—why, Julie—how absurd!” Slowly the colour left
his face.

“I know—we have got to talk it over—it’s all got to be arranged, it’s
terrible. But she is nice, a bright child, a good child.”

“What in the world is all this about?” he demanded, stopping in front of
her. “What are you in this mood for—what have I done?”

“Good heavens! What have you done? What a ridiculous man you are. Why
nothing, of course, absolutely nothing!” She waved her arm. “That’s not
it—why do you bring yourself in? I’m not blaming you, I’m not asking to
be forgiven. I’ve been down on my knees, I’ve beaten my head on the
ground, abased myself, but,” she said in a terrible voice, “it is not
low enough, the ground is not low enough, to bend is not enough; to ask
forgiveness is not enough, to receive it is nothing. There isn’t the
right kind of misery in the world for me to suffer, nor the right kind
of pity for you to feel, there isn’t the right word in the world to heal
me up. It’s good to forgive, to be forgiven, but that’s for ordinary
things. This is beyond that—it’s something you can experience but never
feel—there are not enough nerves, blood cells, flesh—to feel it. You
suffer insufficiently; it’s like drinking insufficiently, sleeping
insufficiently. I’m not asking anything because there is nothing that I
can receive—how primitive to be able to receive——”

“But, Julie——”

“It’s not that,” she said roughly, tears swimming in her eyes. “Of
course I love you. But think of it, a danger to everyone excepting those
like yourself. Curious, involved in a problem affecting only a small per
cent of humanity, sick, frightened, filled with fever and lust
perhaps—with nothing, nothing coming after, whatever you do, but
death—then you go on—it goes on—then the child—and life probably, for a
time.”

“Well——”

“I couldn’t tell you. I thought, ‘Well, I’ll die next month,’ and
finally I didn’t want to go off—although I did, you know what I mean.
Then her father died—they say her lungs are weak—death, death
perpetuating itself, that’s funny you see—and the doctors——” She swung
around: “You’re right—they lied, and I lived through—all the way—all the
way!”

He turned his face from her.

“The real thing,” she went on in a pained voice, “is to turn our torment
toward the perfect design. I didn’t want to go beyond you—that was not
my purpose. I thought there was not to be any more me. I wanted to leave
nothing behind but you, only you. You must believe this or I can’t bear
it—and still,” she continued, walking around the room impatiently,
“there was a somehow hysterical joy in it too. I thought, if you had
real perception, that ‘something’ that we must possess, that must be at
the bottom of us somewhere—or there wouldn’t be such an almost sensuous
desire for it, that ‘something’ that, at times, is so near us that it
becomes obscene, well, I thought, if Paytor has this—and mind you, I
knew all the time that you didn’t have it—that you would understand. And
when you had been gone a long time I said, ‘Paytor understands’—and I
would say to myself—‘Now, at this moment—at ten-thirty precisely, if I
could be with Paytor he would say “I see,”’ but so soon as I had the
time table in my hand I knew that there was no such feeling in your
bosom—nothing at all.”

“Don’t you feel horror?” he asked in a loud voice, suddenly.

“No, I don’t feel horror—horror is conflict—and I have none—I’m alien to
life.”

“Have you a religion, Julie?” he asked, still in the same loud voice, as
if he were addressing someone a little raised, yet invisible, as one
tries to see a choir.

“I don’t know—I don’t think so. I’ve tried to believe in something
external, something that might envelop this and carry it beyond—that’s
what we demand of our faiths, isn’t it? But I always return to a fixed
notion that there is something more fitting than a possible release.”

He put his hands to his head. “You know,” he said, “I’ve always thought
that a woman, because she can have children, ought to know the truth—the
very fact that she can do something so really preposterous ought to make
her equally capable of the other preposterous thing—well——”

She coughed, her handkerchief before her face—she laughed with
brightness. “One learns to be careful about death—but never, never
about——” She didn’t finish but stared before her.

“Why did you bring the child here—why did you return at all then—after
so long a time—it seems all so mixed up?”

“I don’t know—— Perhaps because there is a right and a wrong, and a good
and an evil. I had to find out—and if there’s such a thing as
everlasting mercy—I want to find out about that also—there’s a flavour
of unfamiliar intimacy about it all, though, this Christian treatment——”
She had a way of lifting up the side of her face, closing her eyes. “I
thought—Paytor may know.”

“Know what?”

“Will know—well, will be able to divide me against myself—— Personally I
don’t feel divided—I seem to be a sane and balanced whole—a hopelessly
mixed, but perfect design. So I said Paytor will be able to see where
this divides and departs. Though all the time I never for a moment felt
that there was a system working on a this for that basis, but that there
was only this _and_ that—in other words—I wanted to be set wrong.... You
understand?”

“And you yourself,” he inquired, in the same loud voice, “cannot feel
the war? Well, then, what about me?—you must realize what you have
done—turned everything upside down—oh, I won’t even say betrayed me—it’s
much less than that, what most of us do, we betray circumstances—well, I
can’t do anything for you,” he said sharply. “I can’t do anything at
all—I’m sorry, I’m very sorry—but there it is”—he began to grimace and
twitch his shoulders.

“The child has it too,” Julie Anspacher said, looking up at him. “I
shall die soon.—It’s ridiculous,” she added, with the tears streaming
down her face. “You are strong, always were—and so were all your family
before you—not one of them in their graves under ninety—it’s all
wrong—it’s quite ridiculous.”

“I don’t know. Perhaps it’s not ridiculous. One must be very careful not
to come, too hastily, to a conclusion.” He began searching for his pipe.
“Only you know yourself, Julie, how I torment myself, if it’s a big
enough thing, for days, weeks, years; and the reason is, the real reason
is, that I come to my conclusions instantly, and then fight to destroy
them.” He seemed to Julie a little pompous now. “It’s because first I’m
human, and second, logical. Well, I don’t know—perhaps I’ll be able to
tell you something later—give you a beginning at least—later——” He
twitched his shoulders and went out, closing the door after him. She
heard him climbing the familiar creaking stairs, the yellow painted
stairs that led up into the roof—she heard him strike a match—then
silence.


The dark had begun, closing in about bushes and barn, and filling the
air with moist joyousness, the joyousness of autumn that trusts itself
to the darkness, and Julie leaned on her hand by the shelf and listened.

She could hear, far away and faint, the sound of dogs on heavy chains.
She tried to stop, listening to the outside, but her thoughts rotted
away like clouds in a wind.

The sense of tears came to her, but it was only a sentimental memory of
her early childhood, and it brought a smile to her long face. She had
cried once when they made her kiss a dead priest—“Qui habitare facit
sterilem—matrem filiorum laetantem”—then “Gloria Patri—” and she had
wept then, or thought she had, because he was not only beyond glory and
all mercy, but beyond the dubious comfort of the feeling.

She heard Paytor walking above, and the smoke of his pipe crept down
between loose boards and uneven plaster and laths.

She went—quite mechanically—over to a chest in one corner, and opened
the lid. A shirt waist, of striped taffeta, one she had worn years
before, some old Spanish lace—her mother’s—the child——

Paytor did not seem to like the child—“How ridiculous!” she thought.
“She is good, quiet, gentle—but that’s not enough now.” She removed her
hat. Living with Paytor and the child—Paytor so strong,—always was, and
so was his family—and she sickly, coughing. Perhaps she had made a
mistake in coming back. She went toward the steps to tell this to Paytor
but thought better of it. That wasn’t what she wanted to say.

The hours drew out and Julie Anspacher, sitting now at the window
overlooking the garden—nodded without sleep—long dreams—grotesque and
abominable—stupid irrelevances dull and interminable. Somewhere little
Ann coughed in her sleep. Julie Anspacher coughed also, and in between,
the sound of Paytor walking up and down, and the smell of tobacco
growing stronger.

To take her own life, that was right, if only she had not the habit of
fighting death—“but death is past knowing, and to know is better than to
make right——” She shook her head. “That’s another detour on the wrong
side,” she told herself. “If only I had the power to feel pain as
unbearable, a gust of passion, of impatience, and all would be over—but
I’ve stood so much so long, there is no too long.” She thought what she
would not give for any kind of feeling, anything that was vital and
sudden and determining. “If Paytor will have patience I will get around
to it.”

Then it seemed that something must happen, must inevitably happen.

“If I could only think of the right word before it happens,” she said to
herself, over and over, and over. “It’s because I’m cold and I can’t
think, I’ll think soon——” She would take her jacket off, put on her
coat——

She got up, running her hand along the wall. Or had she left it on the
chair? “I can’t think of the word,” she said to keep her mind on
something.

She turned around. All his family—long lives. “And me too, me too,” she
murmured. She became dizzy. “It is because I must get on my knees—but it
isn’t low enough.” She contradicted herself. “Yet if I put my head
down—way down—down——”

Then she heard the shot. “He has quick warm blood” went through her
mind—and her blood was cold.

Her forehead had not quite touched the boards, now she touched them, but
she got up immediately, stumbling over her dress.




                                PASTORAL


          A frog leaps out across the lawn,
          And crouches there—all heavy and alone,
          And like a blossom, pale and over-blown,
          Once more the moon turns dim against the dawn.

          Crawling across the straggling panoply
          Of little roses, only half in bloom,
          It strides within that beamed and lofty room
          Where an ebon stallion looms upon the hay.

          The stillness moves, and seems to grow immense,
          A shuddering dog starts, dragging at its chain,
          Thin, dusty rats slink down within the grain,
          And in the vale the first far bells commence.

          Here in the dawn, with mournful doomèd eyes
          A cow uprises, moving out to bear
          A soft-lipped calf with swarthy birth-swirled hair,
          And wide wet mouth, and droll uncertainties.

          The grey fowls fight for places in the sun,
          The mushrooms flare, and pass like painted fans:
          All the world is patient in its plans—
          The seasons move forever, one on one.

          Small birds lie sprawling vaguely in the heat,
          And wanly pluck at shadows on their breasts,
          And where the heavy grape-vine leans and rests,
          White butterflies lift up their furry feet.

          The wheat grows querulous with unseen cats;
          A fox strides out in anger through the corn,
          Bidding each acre wake and rise to mourn
          Beneath its sharps and through its throaty flats.

          And so it is, and will be year on year,
          Time in and out of date, and still on time
          A billion grapes plunge bleeding into wine
          And bursting, fall like music on the ear.

          The snail that marks the girth of night with slime,
          The lonely adder hissing in the fern,
          The lizard with its ochre eyes aburn—
          Each is before, and each behind its time.




                                 OSCAR


Before the house rose two stately pine trees, and all about small firs
and hemlocks. The garden path struggled up to the porch between wild
flowers and weeds, and looming against its ancient bulk the shadows of
out-houses and barns.

It stood among the hills, and just below around a curve in the road, lay
the placid grey reservoir.

Sometimes parties would cross the fields, walking slowly toward the
mountains. And sometimes children could be heard murmuring in the
underbrush of things they scarcely knew.

Strange things had happened in this country town. Murder, theft, and
little girls found weeping, and silent morose boys scowling along in the
ragweed, with half-shut sunburned eyelids.

The place was wild, deserted and impossible in Winter. In Summer it was
over-run with artists and town folk with wives and babies. Every
Saturday there were fairs on the green, where second-hand articles were
sold for a song, and flirting was formidable and passing. There were
picnics, mountain climbings, speeches in the townhall, on the mark of
the beast, on sin, and democracy, and once in a while a lecture on
something that “everyone should know,” attended by mothers, their
offspring left with servants who knew what everyone shouldn’t.

Then there were movies, bare legs, deacons, misses in cascades of curls
and on Sunday one could listen to Mr. Widdie, the clergyman, who
suffered from consumption, speak on love of one’s neighbour.

In this house and in this town had lived, for some fifteen years or so,
Emma Gonsberg.

She was a little creature, lively, smiling, extremely good-natured. She
had been married twice, divorced once, and was now a widow still in her
thirties.

Of her two husbands she seldom said anything. Once she made the remark:
“Only fancy, they never did catch on to me at all.”

She tried to be fashionable, did her hair in the Venetian style, wore
gowns after the manner of Lady de Bath entering her carriage; and tried
to cultivate only those who could tell her “where she stood.”

Her son Oscar was fourteen or thereabouts. He wore distinctly
over-decorative English clothes, and remembered two words of some
obscure Indian dialect that seemed to mean “fleas,” for whenever he
flung these words defiantly at visitors they would go off into peals of
laughter, headed by his mother. At such times he would lower his eyes
and show a row of too heavy teeth.

Emma Gonsberg loved flowers, but could not grow them. She admired cats
because there was “nothing servile about them,” but they would not stay
with her; and though she loved horses and longed to be one of those
daring women who could handle them “without being crushed in the
stalls,” they nevertheless ignored her with calm indifference. Of her
loves, passions and efforts, she had managed to raise a few ill-smelling
pheasants, and had to let it go at that.

In the Winter she led a lonely and discriminating life. In the Summer
her house filled with mixed characters, as one might say. A hot
melancholy Jew, an officer who was always upon the point of depreciating
his medals in a conceited voice, and one other who swore inoffensively.

Finally she had given this sort of thing up, partly because she had
managed, soon after, to get herself entangled with a man called Ulric
Straussmann. A tall rough fellow, who said he came from the Tyrol; a
fellow without sensibilities but with a certain bitter sensuality. A
good-natured creature as far as he went, with vivid streaks of German
lust, which had at once something sentimental and something careless
about it; the type who can turn the country, with a single gesture, into
a brothel, and makes of children strong enemies. He showed no little
audacity in putting things into people’s minds that he would not do
himself.

He smelled very strongly of horses, and was proud of it. He pretended a
fondness for all that goes under hide or hair, but a collie bitch, known
for her gentleness, snapped at him and bit him. He invariably carried a
leather thong, braided at the base for a handle, and would stand for
hours talking, with his legs apart, whirling this contrived whip, and,
looking out of the corner of his eyes would pull his moustache, waiting
to see which of the ladies would draw her feet in.

He talked in a rather even, slightly nasal tone, wetting his lips with a
long outthrust of tongue, like an animal. His teeth were splendid and
his tongue unusually red, and he prided himself on these and on the
calves of his legs. They were large, muscular and rather handsome.

He liked to boast that there was nothing that he could not do and be
forgiven, because, as he expressed it, “I have always left people
satisfied.” If it were hate or if it were love, he seemed to have come
off with unusual success. “Most people are puny,” he would add, “while I
am large, strong, healthy. Solid flesh through and through,” whereat he
would pound his chest and smile.

He was new to the town and sufficiently insolent to attract attention.
There was also something childishly naïve in him, as there is in all
tall and robust men who talk about themselves. This probably saved him,
because when he was drinking he often became gross and insulting, but he
soon put the women of the party in a good humour by giving one of them a
hearty and good-natured slap on the rear that she was not likely to
forget.

Besides this man Emma had a few old friends of the less interesting,
though better-read, type. Among them, however, was an exception, Oliver
Kahn, a married man with several children one heard of and never saw. A
strange, quiet man who was always talking. He had splendid eyes and a
poor mouth—very full lips. In the beginning one surmised that he had
been quite an adventurer. He had an odour about him of the rather recent
cult of the “terribly good.” He seemed to have been unkind to his family
in some way, and was spending the rest of his life in a passion of
regret and remorse. He had become one of those guests who are only
missed when absent. He finally stayed for good, sleeping in an ante-room
with his boots on,—his one royal habit.

In the beginning Emma had liked him tremendously. He was at once gentle
and furious, but of late, just prior to the Straussmann affair, he had
begun to irritate her. She thought to herself, “He is going mad, that’s
all.” She was angry at herself for saying “that’s all,” as if she had
expected something different, more momentous.

He had enormous appetites, he ate like a Porthos and drank like a
Pantagruel, and talked hour after hour about the same thing, “Love of
one’s neighbour,” and spent his spare time in standing with his hands
behind him, in front of the pheasants’ cage. He had been a snipe hunter
in his time, and once went on a big game hunt, but now he said he saw
something more significant here.

He had, like all good sportsmen, even shot himself through the hand, but
of late he pretended that he did not remember what the scar came from.

He seemed to suffer a good deal. Evil went deep and good went deep and
he suffered the tortures of the damned. He wept and laughed and ate and
drank and slept, and year by year his eyes grew sweeter, tenderer, and
his mouth fuller, more gross.

The child Oscar did not like Kahn, yet sometimes he would become
extraordinarily excited, talk very fast, almost banteringly, a little
malignly, and once when Kahn had taken his hand he drew it away angrily.
“Don’t,” he said.

“Why not?”

“Because it is dirty,” he retorted maliciously.

“As if you really knew of what I was thinking,” Kahn said, and put his
own hands behind him.

Emma liked Kahn, was attached to him. He mentioned her faults without
regret or reproval, and this in itself was a divine sort of love.

He would remark: “We cannot be just because we are bewildered; we ought
to be proud enough to welcome our enemies as judges, but we hate, and to
hate is the act of the incurious. I love with an everlasting but a
changing love, because I know I am the wrong sort of man to be good—and
because I revere the shadow on the threshold.”

“What shadow, Kahn?”

“In one man we called it Christ—it is energy; for most of us it is dead,
a phantom. If you have it you _are_ Christ, and if you have only a
little of it you are but the promise of the Messiah.”

These seemed great words, and she looked at him with a little admiring
smile.

“You make me uneasy for fear that I have not said ‘I love you with an
everlasting love,’ often enough to make it an act of fanaticism.”

As for Oscar, he did what he liked, which gave him character, but made
him difficult to live with.

He was not one of those “weedy” youths, long of leg, and stringy like
“jerked beef, thank God!” as his mother said to visitors. He was rather
too full-grown, thick of calf and hip and rather heavy of feature. His
hands and feet were not out of proportion as is usually the case with
children of his age, but they were too old looking.

He did not smoke surreptitiously. On the contrary he had taken out a
pipe one day in front of his mother, and filling it, smoked in silence,
not even with a frightened air, and for that matter not even with a
particularly bold air;—he did it quite simply, as something he had
finally decided to do, and Emma Gonsberg had gone off to Kahn with it,
in a rather helpless manner.

Most children swing in circles about a room, clumsily. Oscar on the
contrary walked into the four corners placidly and officially, looked at
the backs of the books here and a picture there, and even grunted
approvingly at one or two in quite a mature manner.

He had a sweetheart, and about her and his treatment of her there were
only a few of the usual signs—he was shy, and passionately immersed in
her, there was little of the casual smartness of first calf love about
it, though he did in truth wave her off with a grin if he was
questioned.

He took himself with seriousness amounting to a lack of humour—and
though he himself knew that he was a youth, and had the earmarks of
adolescence about him—and know it he certainly did—once he said, “Well,
what of it—is that any reason why I should not be serious about
everything?” This remark had so astonished his mother that she had
immediately sent for Kahn to know if he thought the child was
precocious—and Kahn had answered, “If he were, I should be better
pleased.”

“But what is one to expect?”

“Children,” he answered, “are never what they are supposed to be, and
they never have been. He may be old for his age, but what child hasn’t
been?”

In the meantime, she tried to bring Straussmann and Kahn together—“My
house is all at odds,” she thought, but these two never hit it off.
Straussmann always appeared dreadfully superficial and cynical, and Kahn
dull and good about nothing.

“They have both got abnormal appetites,” she thought wearily. She
listened to them trying to talk together of an evening on the piazza
steps. Kahn was saying:

“You must, however, warn yourself, in fact I might say arm yourself,
against any sensation of pleasure in doing good; this is very difficult,
I know, but it can be attained. You can give and forgive and tolerate
gently and, as one might say, casually, until it’s a second nature.”

“There you have it, tolerate—who wants tolerance, or a second nature?
Well, let us drop it. I feel like a child—it’s difficult not to feel
like a child.”

“Like Oscar—he has transports—even at his age,” Emma added hesitatingly.
“Perhaps that’s not quite as it should be?”

“The memory of growing up is worse than the fear of death,” Kahn
remarked, and Emma sighed.

“I don’t know; the country was made for children, they say—I could tell
you a story about that,” Straussmann broke off, whistling to Oscar.
“Shall I tell Oscar about the country—and what it is really like?” he
asked Emma, turning his head.

“Let the boy alone.”

“Why, over there in that small village,” Straussmann went on, taking
Oscar by the arm. “It is a pretty tale I could tell you—perhaps I will
when you are older—but don’t let your mother persuade you that the
country is a nice, healthful, clean place, because, my child, it’s
corrupt.”

“Will you let the boy alone!” Emma cried, turning very red.

“Ah, eh—I’ll let him alone right enough—but it won’t make much
difference—you’ll see,” he went on. “There is a great deal told to
children that they should not hear, I’ll admit, but there wasn’t a thing
I didn’t know when I was ten. It happened one day in a hotel in
Southampton—a dark place, gloomy, smelling frightfully of mildew, the
walls were damp and stained. A strange place, eh, to learn the delights
of love, but then our parents seldom dwell on the delights,—they are too
taken up with the sordid details, the mere sordid details. My father had
a great beard, and I remember thinking that it would have been better if
he hadn’t said such things. I wasn’t much good afterwards for five or
six years, but my sister was different. She enjoyed it immensely and
forgot all about it almost immediately, excepting when I reminded her.”

“Go to bed, Oscar,” Emma said abruptly.

He went, and on going up the steps he did not let his fingers trail
along the spindles of the banisters with his usual “Eeny meeny miny mo,”
etc.

Emma was a little troubled and watched him going up silently, hardly
moving his arms.

“Children should be treated very carefully, they should know as much as
possible, but in a less superficial form than they must know later.”

“I think a child is born corrupt and attains to decency,” Straussmann
said grinning.

“If you please,” Emma cried gaily, “we will talk about things we
understand.”

Kahn smiled. “It’s beautiful, really beautiful,” he said, meaning her
gaiety. He always said complimentary things about her lightness of
spirit, and always in an angry voice.

“Come, come, you are going mad. What’s the good of that?” she said,
abruptly, thinking, “He is a man who discovered himself once too often.”

“You are wrong, Emma, I am not worthy of madness.”

“Don’t be on your guard, Kahn,” she retorted.

Oscar appeared before her suddenly, barefoot. She stared at him. “What
is it?” she at last managed to ask in a faint almost suffocated voice.

“I want to kiss you,” he whispered.

She moved toward him slowly, when, half way, he hurried toward her,
seized her hand, kissed it, and went back into the house.

“My God,” she cried out. “He is beginning to think for himself,” and ran
in after him.

She remembered how she had talked to him the night before, only the
night before. “You must love with an everlasting but a changing love,”
and he became restless. “With an everlasting but a changing love.”

“What do you mean by ‘changing’?” His palms were moist, and his feet
twitched.

“A love that takes in every detail, every element—that can understand
without hating, without distinction, I think.”

“Why do you say, ‘I think’?”

“I mean, I know,” she answered, confused.

“Get that Kahn out, he’s a rascal,” he said, abruptly, grinning.

“What are you saying, Oscar?” she demanded, turning cold. “I’ll never
come to your bed again, take your hands and say ‘Our Father.’”

“It will be all right if you send that man packing,” he said, stressing
the word “packing.”

She was very angry, and half started toward the door. Then she turned
back. “Why do you say that, Oscar?”

“Because he makes you nervous—well, then—because he crouches”; he saw by
his mother’s face that she was annoyed, puzzled, and he turned red to
his ears. “I don’t mean that, I mean he isn’t good; he’s just watching
for something good to happen, to take place——” His voice trailed off,
and he raised his eyes solemn and full of tears to her face. She leaned
down and kissed him, tucking him in like a “little boy.”

“But I’m not a little boy,” he called out to her.

And tonight she did not come down until she thought Kahn and Straussmann
had gone.

Kahn had disappeared, but Straussmann had taken a turn or two about the
place and was standing in the shadow of the stoop when she came out.

“Come,” he said. “What is it that you want?”

“I think it’s religion,” she answered abruptly. “But it’s probably
love.”

“Let us take a walk,” he suggested.

They turned in toward the shadows of the great still mountains and the
denser, more arrogant shadows of the out-houses and barns. She looked
away into the silence, and the night, and a warm sensation as of
pleasure or of something expected but intangible came over her, and she
wanted to laugh, to cry, and thinking of it she knew that it was
neither.

She was almost unconscious of him for a little, thinking of her son. She
raised her long silk skirts about her ankles and tramped off into the
dampness. A whippoorwill was whistling off to the right. It sounded as
if he were on the fence, and Emma stopped and tried to make it out. She
took Ulric’s arm presently, and feeling his muscles swell began to think
of the Bible. “Those who take by the sword shall die by the sword. And
those who live by the flesh shall die by the flesh.”

She wished that she had someone she could believe in. She saw a door
before her mental eye, and herself opening it and saying, “Now tell me
this, and what it means,—only today I was thinking ‘those who live by
the flesh’”—and as suddenly the door was slammed in her face. She
started back.

“You are nervous,” he said in a pleased whisper.

Heavy stagnant shadows sprawled in the path. “So many million leaves and
twigs to make one dark shadow,” she said, and was sorry because it
sounded childishly romantic, quite different from what she had intended,
what she had meant.

They turned the corner of the carriage-house. Something moved, a toad,
grey and ugly, bounced across her feet and into the darkness of the
hedges. Coming to the entrance of the barn they paused. They could
distinguish sleeping hens, the white films moving on their eyes—and
through a window at the back, steam rising from the dung heap.

“There don’t seem to be any real farmers left,” she said aloud, thinking
of some book she had read about the troubles of the peasants and
landholders.

“You’re thinking of my country,” he said smiling.

“No, I wasn’t,” she said. “I was wondering what it is about the country
that makes it seem so terrible?”

“It’s your being a Puritan—a tight-laced delightful little Puritan.”

She winced at the words, and decided to remain silent.

It was true, Straussmann was in a fever of excitement—he was always this
way with women, especially with Emma. He tried to conceal it for the
time being, thinking, rightly, that a display of it would not please her
just at the moment—“but it would be only a matter of minutes when she
would welcome it,” he promised himself, and waited.

He reflected that she would laugh at him. “But she would enjoy it just
the same. The way with all women who have had anything to do with more
than one man and are not yet forty,” he reflected. “They like what they
get, but they laugh at you, and know you are lying——”

“Oh, my God!” Emma said suddenly, drawing her arm away and wiping her
face with her handkerchief.

“What’s the matter?”

“Nothing, it’s the heat.”

“It is warm,” he said dismally.

“I despise everything, I really despise everything, but you won’t
believe—— I mean everything when I say everything—you’ll think I mean
some one thing—won’t you?” she went on hurriedly. She felt that she was
becoming hysterical.

“It doesn’t matter,” he rejoined, walking on beside her, his heart
beating violently. “Down, you dog,” he said aloud.

“What is that?” She raised her eyes and he looked into them, and they
both smiled.

“That’s better. I wish I were God.”

“A desire for a vocation.”

“Not true, and horrid, as usual,” she answered, and she was hot and
angry all at once.

He pulled at his moustache and sniffed. “I can smell the hedges—ah, the
country is a gay deceiver—it smells pleasant enough, but it’s
treacherous. The country, my dear Emma, has done more to corrupt man, to
drag him down, to turn him loose upon his lower instincts, than
morphine, alcohol and women. That’s why I like it, that’s why it’s the
perfect place for women. They are devils and should be driven out, and
as there’s more room in the country and consequently less likelihood of
driving them out in too much of a hurry, there is more time for
amusement.” He watched her out of the corner of his eye as he said these
things to note if they were ill advised. They seemed to leave her cold,
but tense.

A little later they passed the barns again.

“What was that?” Emma asked suddenly.

“I heard nothing.”

But she had heard something, and her heart beat fearfully. She
recognized Oscar’s voice. She reached up signing Straussmann to be
quiet. She did not want him to hear; she wished that the ground would
yawn, would swallow him up.

“See that yellow flower down there,” she said, pointing toward the end
of the path they had just come. “I want it, I must have it, please.” He
did as he was bid, amiably enough.

She listened—she heard the voice of Oscar’s little sweetheart:

“It seems as if we were one already.”... It was high, resolute,
unflagging, without emotion, a childish parroting of some novel. Oscar’s
voice came back, half smothered:

“Do you really care—more than you like Berkeley?”

“Yes, I do,” she answered in the same false treble, “lots more.”

“Come here,” he said softly—the hay rustled.

“I don’t want to—the rye gets into my hair and spoils it.”

“Dolly, do you like the country?”

“Yes, I do,”—without conviction.

“We will go to the city,” he answered.

“Oh, Oscar, you’re so strong,” she giggled, and it sent a cold shudder
through Emma’s being.

Then presently, “What’s the matter, Oscar—why, you’re crying.”

“I’m not—well, then yes, I am—what of it?—you’ll understand, too, some
day.”

She was evidently frightened, because she said in a somewhat loosened
key, “No one would ever believe that we were as much in love as we are,
would they, Oscar?”

“No, why do you ask that?”

“It’s a great pity,” she said again with the false sound, and sighed.

“Do you care? Why do you care?”

Straussmann was coming back with the yellow flower between thumb and
forefinger. Emma ran a little way to meet him.

“Come, let us go home the other way.”

“Rather, let us not go home,” he said, boldly, and took her wrist,
hurting her.

“Ah,” she said. “Vous m’avez blessée d’amour”—ironically.

“Yes, speak French, it helps women like you at such moments,” he said,
brutally, and kissed her.

But kissing him back, she thought, “The fool, why does Oscar take her so
seriously when they are both children, and she is torturing him.”

“My love, my sweet, my little love,” he was babbling.

She tried to quench this, trembling a little. “But tell me, my
friend—no, not so hasty—what do you think of immortality?” He had pushed
her so far back that there was no regaining her composure. “My God, in
other words, what of the will to retribution!”

But she could not go on. “I’ve tried to,” she thought.

Later, when the dawn was almost upon them, he said: “How sad to be
drunk, only to die. For the end of all man is Fate, in other words, the
end of all man is vulgar.”

She felt the need of something that had not been.

“I’m not God, you see, after all.”

“So I see, madam,” he said. “But you’re a damned clever little woman.”

When she came in, she found Kahn lying flat on his back, his eyes wide
open.

“Couldn’t you sleep?”

“No, I could not sleep.”

She was angry. “I’m sorry—you suffer.”

“Yes, a little.”

“Kahn,” she cried in anguish, flinging herself on her knees beside him.
“What should I have done, what shall I do?”

He put his hand on her cheek. “My dear, my dear,” he said, and sighed.
“I perhaps was wrong.”

She listened.

“Very wrong, I see it all now; I am an evil man, an old and an evil
being.”

“No, no!”

“Yes, yes,” he said gently, softly, contradicting her. “Yes, evil, and
pitiful, and weak”; he seemed to be trying to remember something. “What
is it that I have overlooked?” He asked the question in such a confused
voice that she was startled.

“Is it hate?” she asked.

“I guess so, yes, I guess that’s it.”

“Kahn, try to think—there must be something else.”

“Madness.”

She began to shiver.

“Are you cold?”

“No, it’s not cold.”

“No, it’s not cold,” he repeated after her. “You are not cold, Emma, you
are a child.”

Tears began to roll down her cheeks.

“Yes,” he continued sadly. “You too will hear: remorse is the medium
through which the evil spirit takes possession.”

And again he cried out in anguish. “But I’m _not_ superficial—I may have
been wanton, but I’ve not been superficial. I wanted to give up
everything, to abandon myself to whatever IT demanded, to do whatever IT
directed and willed. But the terrible thing is I don’t know what abandon
is. I don’t know when it’s abandon and when it’s just a case of minor
calculation.

“The real abandon is not to know whether one throws oneself off a cliff
or not, and not to care. But I can’t do it, because I must know, because
I’m afraid if I did cast myself off, I should find that I had thrown
myself off the lesser thing after all, and that,” he said in a horrified
voice, “I could never outlive, I could never have faith again. And so it
is that I shall never know, Emma; only children and the naïve know, and
I am too sophisticated to accomplish the divine descent.”

“But you must tell me,” she said, hurriedly. “What am I to do, what am I
to think? My whole future depends on that, on your answer—on knowing
whether I do an injustice not to hate, not to strike, not to kill—well,
you must tell me—I swear it is my life—my entire life.”

“Don’t ask me, I can’t know, I can’t tell. I who could not lead one
small sheep, what could I do with a soul, and what still more could I do
with you? No,” he continued, “I’m so incapable. I am so mystified. Death
would be a release, but it wouldn’t settle anything. It never settles
anything, it simply wipes the slate, it’s merely a way of putting the
sum out of mind, yet I wish I might die. How do I know now but that
everything I have thought, and said, and done, has not been false, a
little abyss from which I shall crawl laughing at the evil of my own
limitation.”

“But the child—what have I been telling Oscar—to love with an
everlasting love——”

“That’s true,” he said.

“Kahn, listen. What have I done to him, what have I done to myself?
What are we all doing here—are we all mad—or are we merely
excited—overwrought, hysterical? I must know, I must know.” She took
his hand and he felt her tears upon it.

“Kahn, is it an everlasting but a changing love—what kind of love is
that?”

“Perhaps that’s it,” he cried, jumping up, and with a gesture tore his
shirt open at the throat. “Look, I want you to see, I run upon the world
with a bared breast—but never find the blade—ah, the civility of our own
damnation—that’s the horror. A few years ago, surely this could not have
happened. Do you know,” he said, turning his eyes all hot and burning
upon her, “the most terrible thing in the world is to bare the breast
and never to feel the blade enter!” He buried his face in his hands.

“But, Kahn, you must think, you must give me an answer. All this
indecision is all very well for us, for all of us who are too old to
change, for all of us who can reach God through some plaything we have
used as a symbol, but there’s my son, what is he to think, to feel, he
has no jester’s stick to shake, nor stool to stand on. Am I responsible
for him? Why,” she cried frantically, “must I be responsible for him? I
tell you I won’t be, I can’t. I won’t take it upon myself. But I have, I
have. Is there something that can make me immune to my own blood? Tell
me—I must wipe the slate—the fingers are driving me mad—can’t he stand
alone now? Oh, Kahn, Kahn!” she cried, kissing his hands. “See, I kiss
your hands, I am doing so much. You must be the prophet—you can’t do
less for the sign I give you—I must know, I must receive an answer, I
_will_ receive it.”

He shook her off suddenly, a look of fear came into his eyes.

“Are you trying to frighten me?” he whispered. She went into the hall,
into the dark, and did not know why, or understand anything. Her mind
was on fire, and it was consuming things that were strange and merciful
and precious.

Finally she went into her son’s room and stood before his bed. He lay
with one feverish cheek against a dirty hand, his knees drawn up; his
mouth had a peculiar look of surprise about it.

She bent down, called to him, not knowing what she was doing. “Wrong,
wrong,” she whispered, and she shook him by the shoulders. “Listen,
Oscar, get up. Listen to me!”

He awoke and cried out as one of her tears, forgotten, cold, struck
against his cheek. An ague shook his limbs. She brought her face close
to his.

“Son, hate too, that is inevitable—irrevocable——”

He put out his two hands and pushed them against her breast and in a
subdued voice said, “Go away, go away,” and he looked as if he were
about to cry, but he did not cry.

She turned and fled into the hall.

However, in the morning, at breakfast, there was nothing unusual about
her, but a tired softness and yielding of spirit; and at dinner, which
was always late, she felt only a weary indifference when she saw
Straussmann coming up the walk. He had a red and white handkerchief
about his throat, and she thought, “How comic he looks.”

“Good evening,” he said.

“Good evening,” she answered, and a touch of her old gaiety came into
her voice. Kahn was already seated, and now she motioned Straussmann to
follow. She began slicing the cold potted beef and asked them about
sugar in their tea, adding, “Oscar will be here soon.” To Kahn she
showed only a very little trace of coldness, of indecision.

“No,” Straussmann said, still standing, legs apart: “If you’ll excuse
me, I’d like a word or two with Kahn.” They stepped off the porch
together.

“Kahn,” he said, going directly to the point, “listen,” he took hold of
Kahn’s coat by the lapel. “You have known Emma longer than I have,
you’ve got to break it to her.” He flourished a large key under Kahn’s
nose, as he spoke.

“I’ve got him locked up in the out-house safe enough for the present,
but we must do something immediately.”

“What’s the matter?” A strange, pleasant but cold sweat broke out upon
Kahn’s forehead.

“I found Oscar sitting beside the body of his sweetheart,
what’s-her-name; he had cut her throat with a kitchen knife, yes, with a
kitchen knife—he seemed calm, but he would say nothing. What shall we
do?”

“They’ll say he was a degenerate from the start——”

“Those who live by the flesh—eh?”

“No,” Kahn said, in a confused voice, “that’s not it.”

They stood and stared at each other so long that presently Emma grew
nervous and came down the garden path to hear what it was all about.

[Illustration]




                                ANTIQUE


                A lady in a cowl of lawn
                With straight bound tabs and muted eyes,
                And lips fair thin and deftly drawn
                    And oddly wise.

                A cameo, a ruff of lace,
                A neck cut square with corners laid;
                A thin Greek nose and near the face
                    A polished braid.

                Low, sideways looped, of amber stain
                The pale ears caught within its snare.
                A profile like a dagger lain
                    Between the hair.




                          KATRINA SILVERSTAFF


“We have eaten a great deal, my friend, against the day of God.”

She was a fine woman, hard, magnificent, cold, Russian, married to a
Jew, a doctor on the East Side.

You know that kind of woman, pale, large, with a heavy oval face.

A woman of ‘material’—a lasting personality, in other words, a
‘fashionable’ woman, a woman who, had she lived to the age of forty odd,
would have sat for long fine hours by some window, overlooking some
desolate park, thinking of a beautiful but lazy means to an end.

She always wore large and stylish hats, and beneath them her mouth took
on a look of pain at once proud, aristocratic and lonely.

She had studied medicine—but medicine in the interest of animals; she
was a good horse doctor—an excellent surgeon on the major injuries to
birds and dogs.

In fact she and her husband had met in a medical college in Russia—she
had been the only woman in the class, the only one of the lot of them
who smiled in a strange, hurt and sarcastic way when dissecting.

The men treated her like one of them, that is, they had no cringing
mannerliness about their approach, they lost no poise before her, and
tried no tricks as one might say.

The Silverstaffs had come to America, they had settled on the East Side,
among ‘their own people’ as he would say; she never said anything when
he talked like this, she sat passive, her hands in her lap, but her
nostrils quivered, and somewhere under the skin of her cheek something
trembled.

Her husband was the typical Jewish intellectual, a man with stiff,
short, greying hair, prominent intelligent and kindly eyes, rather
short, rather round, always smelling of Greek salad and carbolic acid,
and always intensely interested in new medical journals, theories,
discoveries.

He was a little dusty, a little careless, a little timid, but always
gentle.

They had been in America scarcely eight months before the first child
was born, a girl, and then following on her heels a boy, and then no
more children.

Katrina Silverstaff stopped having her children as abruptly as she had
begun having them; something complicated had entered her mind, and where
there are definite complications of the kind that she suffered, there
are no more children.

“We have eaten a great deal, my friend, against the day of God,” she had
said that.

She had said that one night, sitting in the dusk of their office. There
was something inexpressibly funny in their sitting together in this
office, with its globe of the world, its lung charts, its weighing
machine, its surgical chair, and its bowl of ineffectual goldfish.
Something inexpressibly funny and inexpressibly fecund, a fecundity
suppressed by coldness, and a terrible determination—more terrible in
that her husband Otto felt nothing of it.

He was very fond of her, and had he been a little more sensitive he
would have been very glad to be proud of her. She never became
confidential with him, and he never tried to overstep this, partly
because he was unaware of it, and partly because he felt little need of
a closer companionship.

She was a fine woman, he knew that; he never thought to question
anything she did, because it was little, nor what she said, because it
was less; there was an economy about her existence that simply forbade
questioning. He felt in some dim way, that to criticize at all would be
to stop everything.

Their life was typical of the East Side doctor’s life. Patients all day
for him, and the children for her, with an occasional call from someone
who had a sick bird. In the evening they would sit around a table with
just sufficient food, with just sufficient silver and linen, and one
luxury: Katrina’s glass of white wine.

Or sometimes they would go out to dine, to some kosher place, where
everyone was too friendly and too ugly and too warm, and here he would
talk of the day’s diseases while she listened to the music and tried not
to hear what her daughter was crying for.

He had always been a ‘liberal,’ from the first turn of the cradle. In
the freedom of the people, in the betterment of conditions, he took the
interest a doctor takes in seeing a wound heal.

As for Katrina Silverstaff, she never said anything about it, he never
knew what she really thought, if she thought at all; it did not seem
necessary for her to do or say anything, she was fine as she was, where
she was. On the other hand it never occurred to him that she would not
hear, with calmness at least, his long dissertations on capital.

At the opening of this story, Katrina’s daughter was a little girl of
ten, who was devoted to dancing, and who lay awake at nights worrying
about the shape of her legs, which had already begun to swell with a
dancer’s muscles.

The boy was nine, thin, and wore spectacles.

And of course what happened was quite unaccountable.

A man, calling himself Castillion Rodkin, passed through one Summer,
selling Carlyle’s “French Revolution.” Among the houses where he had
left a copy was the house of Otto Silverstaff.

Katrina had opened the door, the maid was down with the measles, and the
doctor was busy with a patient, a Jew much revered for his poetry.

She never bought anything of peddlers, and she seldom said more than
“No, thank you.” In this case she neither said “Thank you,” nor closed
the door—instead she held it open, standing a little aside for him to
pass, and, utterly astonished, he did pass, waiting behind her in the
hall for orders.

“We will go into the study,” she said, “my husband is busy.”

“I was selling Bibles last year,” he remarked, “but they do not go down
in this section.”

“Yes,” she answered, “I see,” and she moved before him into the heavy
damp parlour which was never unshuttered and which was never used. She
reached up and turned on one solitary electric light.

Castillion Rodkin might have been of any nationality in the world; this
was partly from having travelled in all countries, and also from a fluid
temperament—little was fixed or firm in him, a necessary quality in a
salesman.

Castillion Rodkin was below medium height, thin and bearded with a pale,
almost white growth of hair. He was peculiarly colourless, his eyes were
only a shade darker than his temples, and very restless.

She said simply, “We must talk about religion.”

And with an awkwardness unusual to him he asked “Why?”

“Because,” she said in a strained voice, making a hurt gesture, “it is
so far from me.”

He did not know what to say, of course, and lifting one thin leg in its
white trousers he placed it carefully over the other.

She was sitting opposite him, her head turned a little to one side, not
looking at anything. “You see,” she said presently, “I want religion to
become out of the reach of the few.”

“Become’s a queer word,” he said.

“It is the only word,” she answered, and there was a slight irritation
in her voice, “because it is so irrevocably for the many.”

“Yes,” he said mechanically, and reached up to his beard, leaving his
hand there under a few strands of hair.

“You see,” she went on simply, “I can come to the point. For me,
everything is a lie—I am not telling this to you because I need your
help, I shall never need help,” she said, turning her eyes on his,
“understand that from the beginning——”

“Beginning,” he said in a loud voice suddenly.

“From the beginning,” she repeated calmly, “right from the very start,
not help but hindrance, I need enough hindrance, a total obstacle,
otherwise I cannot accomplish it.”

“Accomplish what, madame?” he asked and took his hand from under his
beard.

“That is my affair, mine alone, that you must not question, it has
nothing to do with you, you are only a means to an end.”

He said, “What can I do for you?”

She smiled, a sudden smile, and under her cheek something flickered.
“You can do nothing,” she said and stood up. “I must always do it
all—yes, I shall be your mistress—wait,” she said raising her hand, and
there was anger and pride in her. “Do not intrude now by word or sign,
but tomorrow you will come to me—that is enough—that is all you can do,”
and in this word “all” he felt a limit on himself that he had never
known before, and he was frightened and disquieted and unhappy.

He came the next day, cringing a little, fawning, uneasy, and she would
not see him—she sent word “I do not need you yet,” and he called again
the next day and learned that she was out of town, then one Sunday she
was in to him.

She said quietly to him, as if she were preparing him for a great
disappointment, “I have deliberately, very deliberately, removed remorse
from the forbidden fruit,” and he was abject suddenly and trembling.

“There will be no thorns for you,” she went on in a cold abrupt voice.
“You will miss that, but do not presume to show it in my presence.”

“Also my floor is not the floor on which you may crawl,” she continued,
“and I do not permit you to suffer while I am in the room—and,” she
added, unfastening her brooch slowly and precisely, “I dislike all
spiritual odours.”

“Are we all strange?” he whispered.

“It takes more than will to attain to madness.”

“Yes.”

Then she was silent for a while, thinking.

“I want to suffer,” he murmured, and trembled again.

“We are all gross at times, but this is not your time.”

“I could follow you into the wilderness.”

“I would not miss you.”

And it was said in a terrible forbidding voice.

“I suffer as a birthright—I want it to be something more my own than
that.”

“What are you going to do?” he said.

“Does one ever destroy oneself who is utterly disinterested?”

“I don’t know.”

Presently she said, “I love my husband—I want you to know that, it
doesn’t matter, but I want you to know that, and that I am content with
him, and quite happy——”

“Yes,” Castillion Rodkin answered and began trembling again, holding on
to the sides of the bed.

“But there is something in me,” she continued, “that is very mournful
because it is being.”

He could not answer and tears came to his eyes.

“There is another thing,” she said with abrupt roughness, “that I must
insist on, that is that you will not insult me by your presence while
you are in this room.”

He tried to stop his weeping now, and his body grew tense, abject.

“You see,” she continued, “some people drink poison, some take a knife,
and others drown; I take you.”

In the very early dawn, she sat up with a strange smile. “Will you
smoke?” she said, and lit him a cigarette. Then she withdrew into
herself, sitting on the edge of the mahogany boards, her hands in her
lap.

And there was a little ease, and a little comfort in Castillion Rodkin,
and he turned, drawing up one foot, thrusting his hand beneath his
beard, slowly smoking his cigarette.

“Does one regret?” he asked, and the figure of Katrina never moved, nor
did she seem to hear.

“You know, you frightened me—last night,” he went on, lying on his back
now and looking at the ceiling. “I almost became something—something.”

There was a long silence.

“Shall the beasts of the field and the birds of the air forsake thee?”
he said gloomily, then brightly. “Shall any man forsake thee?”

Katrina Silverstaff remained as she was, but under her cheek something
quivered.

The dawn was very near and the street lamps had gone out; a milk cart
rattled across the square, and passed up a side street.

“One out of many, or only one?”

He put his cigarette out, he was beginning to breathe with difficulty,
he was beginning to shiver.

“Well——”

He turned over, got up, stood on the floor.

“Is there nothing I can say?” he began, and went a little away and put
his things on.

“When shall I see you again?”

And now a cold sweat broke out on him, and his chin trembled.

“Tomorrow?”

He tried to come toward her, but he found himself near the door instead.

“I’m nothing,” he said, and turned toward her, bent slightly; he wanted
to kiss her feet—but nothing helped him.

“You’ve taken everything now, now I cannot feel, I do not suffer——” He
tried to look at her—and succeeded finally after a long time.

He could see that she did not know he was in the room.

Then something like horror entered him, and with a soft, swift running
gait he reached the door, turned the handle and was gone.

A few days later, at dusk, for his heart was the heart of a dog, he came
into Katrina’s street, and looked at the house.

A single length of crape, bowed, hung at the door.

From that day he began to drink heavily, he got to be quite a nuisance
in the cafés, he seldom had money to pay, he was a fearless beggar,
almost insolent, and once when he saw Otto Silverstaff sitting alone in
a corner, with his two children, he laughed a loud laugh and burst into
tears.




                            HUSH BEFORE LOVE


            A voice rose in the darkness saying “Love,”
            And in the stall the scattered mice grew still,
            Where yet the white ox slept, and on the sill
            The crowing cock paused, and the grey house dove
            Turned twice about upon the ledge above.




                           THE ROBIN’S HOUSE


In a stately decaying mansion, on the lower end of the Avenue, lived a
woman by the name of Nelly Grissard.

Two heavy cocks stood on either side of the brownstone steps, looking
out toward the park; and in the back garden a fountain, having poured
out its soul for many a year, still poured, murmuring over the stomachs
of the three cherubim supporting its massive basin.

Nelly Grissard was fat and lively to the point of excess. She never let
a waxed floor pass under her without proving herself light of foot.
Every ounce of Nelly Grissard was on the jump. Her fingers tapped, her
feet fluttered, her bosom heaved; her entire diaphragm swelled with
little creakings of whale-bone, lace and taffeta.

She wore feathery things about the throat, had a liking for deep
burgundy silks, and wore six petticoats for the “joy of discovering that
I’m not so fat as they say.” She stained her good square teeth with
tobacco, and cut her hair in a bang.

Nelly Grissard was fond of saying: “I’m more French than human.” Her
late husband had been French; had dragged his nationality about with him
with the melancholy of a man who had half dropped his cloak and that
cloak his life, and in the end, having wrapped it tightly about him, had
departed as a Frenchman should.

There had been many “periods” in Nelly Grissard’s life, a Russian, a
Greek, and those privileged to look through her key-hole said, even a
Chinese.

She believed in “intuition,” but it was always first-hand intuition; she
learned geography by a strict system of love affairs—never two men from
the same part of the country.

She also liked receiving “spirit messages”—they kept her in touch with
international emotion—she kept many irons in the fire and not the least
of them was the “spiritual” iron.

Then she had what she called a “healing touch”—she could take away
headaches, and she could tell by one pass of her hand if the bump on
that particular head was a bump of genius or of avarice—or if (and she
used to shudder, closing her eyes and withdrawing her hand with a slow,
poised and expectant manner) it was the bump of the senses.

Nelly was, in other words, dangerously careful of her sentimentalism. No
one but a sentimental woman would have called her great roomy mansion
“The Robin’s House,” no one but a sentimentalist could possibly have
lived through so many days and nights of saying “yes” breathlessly, or
could have risen so often from her bed with such a magnificent and
knowing air.

No one looking through the gratings of the basement window would have
guessed at the fermenting mind of Nelly Grissard. Here well-starched
domestics rustled about, laying cool fingers on cool fowls and frosted
bottles. The cook, it is true, was a little untidy; he would come and
stand in the entry, when Spring was approaching, and look over the head
of Nelly Grissard’s old nurse, who sat in a wheel-chair all day, her
feeble hands crossed over a discarded rug of the favourite burgundy
colour, staring away with half-melted eyes into the everlasting
fountain, while below the cook’s steaming face, on a hairy chest, rose
and fell a faded holy amulet.

Sometimes the world paused to see Nelly Grissard pounce down the steps,
one after another, and with a final swift and high gesture take her
magnificent legs out for a drive, the coachman cracking his whip, the
braided ribbons dancing at the horses’ ears.

And that was about all—no, if one cared to notice, a man, in the early
forties, who passed every afternoon just at four, swinging a heavy black
cane.

This man was Nicholas Golwein—half Tartar, half Jew.

There was something dark, evil and obscure about Nicholas Golwein, and
something bending, kindly, compassionate. Yet he was a very Jew by
nature. He rode little, danced less, but smoked great self-reassuring
cigars, and could out-ponder the average fidgety American by hours.

He had travelled, he had lived as the “Romans lived,” and had sent many
a hot-eyed girl back across the fields with something to forget or
remember, according to her nature.

This man had been Nelly Grissard’s lover at the most depraved period of
Nelly’s life. At that moment when she was colouring her drinking water
green, and living on ox liver and “testina en broda,” Nicholas Golwein
had turned her collar back, and kissed her on that intimate portion of
the throat where it has just left daylight, yet has barely passed into
the shadow of the breast.

To be sure, Nelly Grissard had been depraved at an exceedingly early
age, if depravity is understood to be the ability to enjoy what others
shudder at, and to shudder at what others enjoy.

Nelly Grissard dreamed “absolutely honestly”—stress on the
absolutely—when it was all the fashion to dream obscurely,—she could
sustain the conversation just long enough not to be annoyingly
brilliant, she loved to talk of ancient crimes, drawing her stomach in,
and bending her fingers slightly, just slightly, but also just enough to
make the guests shiver a little and think how she really should have
been born in the time of the Cenci. And during the craze for Gauguin she
was careful to mention that she had passed over the same South Sea
roads, but where Gauguin had walked, she had been carried by two
astonished donkeys.

She had been “kind” to Nicholas Golwein just long enough to make the
racial melancholy blossom into a rank tall weed. He loved beautiful
things, and she possessed them. He had become used to her, had
“forgiven” her much (for those who had to forgive at all had to forgive
Nelly in a large way), and the fact that she was too fluid to need one
person’s forgiveness long, drove him into slow bitterness and despair.

The fact that “her days were on her,” and that she did not feel the
usual woman’s fear of age and dissolution, nay, that she even saw new
measures to take, possessing a fertility that can only come of a
decaying mind, drove him almost into insanity.

When the Autumn came, and the leaves were falling from the trees, as
nature grew hot and the last flames of the season licked high among the
branches, Nicholas Golwein’s cheeks burned with a dull red, and he
turned his eyes down.

Life did not exist for Nicholas Golwein as a matter of day and after
day—it was flung at him from time to time as a cloak is flung a flunkey,
and this made him proud, morose, silent.

Was it not somehow indecent that, after his forgiveness and
understanding, there should be the understanding and forgiveness of
another?

There was undoubtedly something cruel about Nelly Grissard’s love; she
took at random, and Nicholas Golwein had been the most random, perhaps,
of all. The others, before him, had all been of her own class—the first
had even married her, and when she finally drove him to the knife’s
edge, had left her a fair fortune. Nicholas Golwein had always earned
his own living, he was an artist and lived as artists live. Then Nelly
came—and went—and after him she had again taken one of her own kind, a
wealthy Norwegian—Nord, a friend of Nicholas’.

Sometimes now Nicholas Golwein would go off into the country, trying to
forget, trying to curb the tastes that Nelly’s love had nourished. He
nosed out small towns, but he always came hurriedly back, smelling of
sassafras, the dull penetrating odour of grass, contact with trees,
half-tamed animals.

The country made him think of Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony—he would
start running—running seemed a way to complete all that was sketchy and
incomplete about nature, music, love.

“Would I recognize God if I saw him?” The joy of thinking such thoughts
was not every man’s, and this cheered him.

Sometimes he would go to see Nord; he was not above visiting Nelly’s
lover—in fact there was that between them.

He had fancied death lately. There was a tremendously sterile quality
about Nicholas Golwein’s fancies; they were the fancies of a race, and
not of a man.

He discussed death with Nord—before the end there is something pleasant
in a talk of a means to an end, and Nord had the coldness that makes
death strong.

“I can hate,” he would say, watching Nord out of the corner of his eye;
“Nelly can’t, she’s too provincial——”

“Yes, there’s truth in that. Nelly’s good to herself—what more is
there?”

“There’s understanding.” He meant compassion, and his eyes filled. “Does
she ever speak of me?”

It was beginning to rain. Large drops struck softly against the café
window and thinning out ran down upon the sill.

“Oh, yes.”

“And she says?”

“Why are you never satisfied with what you have, Nicholas?”

Nicholas Golwein turned red. “One dish of cream and the cat should lick
his paws into eternity. I suppose one would learn how she felt, if she
feels at all, if one died.”

“Why, yes, I suppose so.”

They looked at each other, Nicholas Golwein in a furtive manner, moving
his lips around his cigar—Nord absently, smiling a little. “Yes, that
would amuse her.”

“What?” Nicholas Golwein paused in his smoking and let his hot eyes rest
on Nord.

“Well, if you can manage it——”

Nicholas Golwein made a gesture, shaking his cuff-links like a
harness—“I can manage it,” he said, wondering what Nord was thinking.

“Of course it’s rather disgusting,” Nord said.

“I know, I know I should go out like a gentleman, but there’s more in me
than the gentleman, there’s something that understands meanness; a Jew
can only love and be intimate with the thing that’s a little abnormal,
and so I love what’s low and treacherous and cunning, because there’s
nobility and uneasiness in it for me—well,” he flung out his arms—“if
you were to say to Nell, ‘He hung himself in the small hours, with a
sheet’—what then? Everything she had ever said to me, been to me, will
change for her—she won’t be able to read those French journals in the
same way, she won’t be able to swallow water as she has always swallowed
it. I know, you’ll say there’s nature and do you know what I’ll answer:
that I have a contempt for animals—just because they do not have to
include Nelly Grissard’s whims in their means to a living conduct—well,
listen, I’ve made up my mind to something”—he became calm all of a
sudden and looked Nord directly in the face.

“Well?”

“I shall follow you up the stairs, stand behind the door, and you shall
say just these words, ‘Nicholas has hung himself.’”

“And then what?”

“That’s all, that’s quite sufficient—then I shall know everything.”

Nord stood up, letting Nicholas open the café door for him.

“You don’t object?” Nicholas Golwein murmured.

Nord laughed a cold, insulting laugh. “It will amuse her——”

Nicholas nodded, “Yes, we’ve held the coarse essentials between our
teeth like good dogs—” he said, trying to be insulting in turn, but it
only sounded pathetic, sentimental.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Without a word passing between them, on the following day, they went up
the stairs of Nelly Grissard’s house, together. The door into the inner
room was ajar, and Nicholas crept in behind this, seating himself on a
little table.

He heard Nord greet Nelly, and Nelly’s voice answering—“Ah, dear”—he
listened no further for a moment, his mind went back, and he seemed to
himself to be peaceful and happy all at once. “A binding up of old
sores,” he thought, a oneness with what was good and simple—with
everything that evil had not contorted.

“Religion,” he thought to himself, resting his chin on his
hands—thinking what religion had meant to all men at all times, but to
no man in his most need. “Religion is a design for pain—that’s it.” Then
he thought, that, like all art, must be fundamentally against God—God
had made his own plans—well, of that later——

Nelly had just said something—there had been a death-like silence, then
her cry, but he had forgotten to listen to what it was that had passed.
He changed hands on his cane. “There is someone in heaven,” he found his
mind saying. The rising of this feeling was pleasant—it seemed to come
from the very centre of his being. “There’s someone in heaven—who?” he
asked himself, “who?” But there was no possible answer that was not
blasphemy.

“Jews do not kill themselves——”

Nelly’s voice. He smiled—there was someone in heaven, but no one here.
“I’m coming,” he murmured to himself—and felt a sensuous giving away in
the promise.

His eyes filled. What was good in death had been used up long ago—now it
was only dull repetition—death had gone beyond the need of death.

Funnily enough he thought of Nelly as she was that evening when she had
something to forgive. He had pulled her toward him by one end of a
burgundy ribbon, “Forgive, forgive,” and she had been kind enough not to
raise him, not to kiss him, saying, “I forgive”—she just stood there
showing her tobacco-stained teeth in a strong laugh, “Judas eliminated.”
He put his hand to his mouth, “I have been _There_,” and _There_ seemed
like a place where no one had ever been. How cruel, how monstrous!

Someone was running around the room, heavy, ponderous. “She always
prided herself on her lightness of foot,” and here she was running like
a trapped animal, making little cries, “By the neck!”—strange words,
horrifying—unreal——

“To be a little meaner than the others, a little more crafty”—well, he
had accomplished that, too.

Someone must be leaning on the couch, it groaned. That took him back to
Boulogne; he had loved a girl once in Boulogne, and once in the dark
they had fallen, it was like falling through the sky, through the stars,
finding that the stars were not only one layer thick, but that there
were many layers, millions of layers, a thickness to them, and a
depth—then the floor—that was like a final promise of something sordid,
but lasting—firm.

Sounds rose from the streets; automobiles going uptown, horses’ hoofs, a
cycle siren,—that must be a child,—long drawn out, and piercing—yes,
only a child would hold on to a sound like that.

“Life is life,” Nelly had just said, firmly, decisively. After all he
had done this well—he had never been able to think of death long, but
now he had thought of it, made it pretty real—he remembered sparrows,
for some unknown reason, and this worried him.

“The line of the hips, simply Renoir over again——”

They were on the familiar subject of art.

The sounds in the room twittered about him like wings in a close garden,
where there is neither night nor day. “There is a power in death, even
the thought of death, that is very terrible and very beautiful——” His
cane slipped, and struck the floor.

“What was that?” the voice of Nelly Grissard was high, excited,
startled——

“A joke.”

Nicholas Golwein suddenly walked into the room.

“A joke,” he said and looked at them both, smiling.

Nelly Grissard, who was on her knees, and who was holding Nord’s shoe in
one hand, stared at him. It seemed that she must have been about to kiss
Nord’s foot.

Nicholas Golwein bowed, a magnificent bow, and was about to go.

“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” Nelly Grissard cried, angrily,
and got to her feet.

He began to stammer: “I—I am leaving town—I wanted to pay my respects——”

“Well, go along with you——”

Nicholas Golwein went out, shutting the door carefully behind him.




                                PARADISE


             This night I’ve been one hour in Paradise;
             There found a feather from the Cock that Crew—
             There heard the echo of the Kiss that Slew,
             And in the dark, about past agonies
                 Hummed little flies.




                             NO-MAN’S-MARE


Pauvla Agrippa had died that afternoon at three; now she lay with quiet
hands crossed a little below her fine breast with its transparent skin
showing the veins as filmy as old lace, purple veins that were now only
a system of charts indicating the pathways where her life once flowed.

Her small features were angular with that repose which she had often
desired. She had not wanted to live, because she did not mind death.
There were no candles about her where she lay, nor any flowers. She had
said quite logically to her sisters: “Are there any candles and flowers
at a birth?” They saw the point, but regretted the philosophy, for
buying flowers would have connected them with Pauvla Agrippa, in this,
her new adventure.

Pauvla Agrippa’s hair lay against her cheeks like pats of plated butter;
the long golden ends tucked in and wound about her head and curved
behind her neck. Pauvla Agrippa had once been complimented on her fine
black eyes and this yellow hair of hers, and she had smiled and been
quite pleased, but had drawn attention to the fact that she had also
another quite remarkable set of differences—her small thin arms with
their tiny hands and her rather long narrow feet.

She said that she was built to remain standing; now she could rest.

Her sister, Tasha, had been going about all day, praying to different
objects in search of one that would give her comfort, though she was not
so much grieved as she might have been, because Pauvla Agrippa had been
so curious about all this.

True, Agrippa’s husband seemed lost, and wandered about like a restless
dog, trying to find a spot that would give him relief as he smoked.

One of Pauvla’s brothers was playing on the floor with Pauvla’s baby.
This baby was small and fat and full of curves. His arms curved above
his head, and his legs curved downward, including his picture book and
rattle in their oval. He shouted from time to time at his uncle, biting
the buttons on his uncle’s jacket. This baby and this boy had one thing
in common—a deep curiosity—a sense that somewhere that curiosity would
be satisfied. They had all accomplished something. Pauvla Agrippa and
her husband and her sister and the boy and Pauvla’s baby, but still
there was incompleteness about everything.

Nothing was ever done; there wasn’t such a thing as rest, that was
certain, for the sister still felt that her prayers were not definite,
the husband knew he would smoke again after lunch, the boy knew he was
only beginning something, as the baby also felt it, and Pauvla Agrippa
herself, the seemingly most complete, had yet to be buried. Her body was
confronted with the eternal necessity of change.

It was all very sad and puzzling, and rather nice too. After all, atoms
were the only things that had imperishable existence, and therefore were
the omnipotent quality and quantity—God should be recognized as
something that was everywhere in millions, irrevocable and
ineradicable—one single great thing has always been the prey of the
million little things. The beasts of the jungle are laid low by the
insects. Yes, she agreed that everything was multiple that counted.
Pauvla was multiple now, and some day they would be also. This was the
reason that she wandered from room to room touching things, vases,
candlesticks, tumblers, knives, forks, the holy pictures and statues and
praying to each of them, praying for a great thing, to many presences.

A neighbour from across the way came to see them while Pauvla’s brother
was still playing with the baby. This man was a farmer, once upon a
time, and liked to remember it, as city-bred men in the country like to
remember New York and its sophistication.

He spent his Summers, however, in the little fishing village where the
sisters, Pauvla and Tasha, had come to know him. He always spoke of
“going toward the sea.” He said that there was something more than wild
about the ocean; it struck him as being a little unnatural, too.

He came in now grumbling and wiping his face with a coarse red
handkerchief, remarking on the “catch” and upon the sorrow of the house
of Agrippa, all in the one breath.

“There’s a touch of damp in the air,” he said, sniffing, his nose held
back so that his small eyes gleamed directly behind it. “The fish have
been bad catching and no-man’s-mare is going up the headlands, her tail
stretched straight out.”

Tasha came forward with cakes and tea and paused, praying over them
also, still looking for comfort. She was a small woman, with a round,
wrinkled forehead and the dark eyes of her sister; today she felt
inconvenienced because she could not understand her own feelings—once or
twice she had looked upon the corpse with resentment because it had done
something to Pauvla; however, she was glad to see the old man, and she
prayed to him silently also, to see if it would help. Just what she
prayed for she could not tell; the words she used were simple: “What is
it, what is it?” over and over with her own childhood prayers to end
with.

She had a great deal of the quietness of this village about her, the
quietness that is in the roaring of the sea and the wind, and when she
sighed it was like the sound made of great waters running back to sea
between the narrow sides of little stones.

It was here that she, as well as her brothers and sisters, had been
born. They fished in the fishing season and sold to the market at
one-eighth of the market price, but when the markets went so low that
selling would put the profits down for months, they turned the nets over
and sent the fish back to sea.

Today Tasha was dressed in her ball-gown; she had been anticipating a
local gathering that evening and then Pauvla Agrippa got her heart
attack and died. This dress was low about the shoulders, with flounces
of taffeta, and the sea-beaten face of Tasha rose out of its stiff
elegance like a rock from heavy moss. Now that she had brought the cakes
and tea, she sat listening to this neighbour as he spoke French to her
younger brother.

When they spoke in this strange language she was always surprised to
note that their voices became unfamiliar to her—she could not have told
which was which, or if they were themselves at all. Closing her eyes,
she tried to see if this would make any difference, and it didn’t. Then
she slowly raised her small plump hands and pressed them to her
ears—this was better, because now she could not tell that it was French
that they were speaking, it was sound only and might have been anything,
and again she sighed, and was glad that they were less strange to her;
she could not bear this strangeness today, and wished they would stop
speaking in a foreign tongue.

“What are you saying?” she enquired, taking the teacup in one hand,
keeping the other over her ear.

“Talking about the horse,” he said, and went on.

Again Tasha became thoughtful. This horse that they were speaking about
had been on the sands, it seemed to her, for as long as she could
remember. It was a wild thing belonging to nobody. Sometimes in a coming
storm, she had seen it standing with its head out toward the waters, its
mane flying in the light air, and its thin sides fluttering with the
beating of its heart.

It was old now, with sunken flanks and knuckled legs; it no longer stood
straight—and the hair about its nose had begun to turn grey. It never
interfered with the beach activities, and on the other hand it never
permitted itself to be touched. Early in her memory of this animal,
Tasha had tried to stroke it, but it had started, arched its neck and
backed away from her with hurried jumping steps. Many of the ignorant
fisherfolk had called it the sea horse and also “no-man’s-mare.” They
began to fear it, and several of them thought it a bad omen.

Tasha knew better—sometimes it would be down upon the pebbly part of the
shore, its head laid flat as though it were dead, but no one could
approach within fifty feet without its instantly leaping up and standing
with its neck thrust forward and its brown eyes watching from beneath
the coarse lashes.

In the beginning people had tried to catch it and make it of use.
Gradually everyone in the village had made the attempt; not one of them
had ever succeeded.

The large black nostrils were always wet, and they shook as though
someone were blowing through them—great nostrils like black flowers.

This mare was old now and did not get up so often when approached. Tasha
had been as near to it as ten paces, and Pauvla Agrippa had once
approached so near that she could see that its eyes were failing, that a
thin mist lay over its right eyeball, so that it seemed to be flirting
with her, and this made her sad and she hurried away, and she thought,
“The horse had its own defence; when it dies it will be so horrifying
perhaps that not one of us will approach it.” Though many had squabbled
about which of them should have its long beautiful tail.

Pauvla Agrippa’s husband had finished his cigar and came in now, bending
his head to get through the low casement. He spoke to the neighbour a
few moments and then sat down beside his sister-in-law.

He began to tell her that something would have to be done with Pauvla,
and added that they would have to manage to get her over to the
undertaker’s at the end of the headland, but that they had no means of
conveyance. Tasha thought of this horse because she had been thinking
about it before he interrupted and she spoke of it timidly, but it was
only an excuse to say something.

“You can’t catch it,” he said, shaking his head.

Here the neighbour broke in: “It’s easy enough to catch it; this last
week three children have stroked it—it’s pretty low, I guess; but I
doubt if it would be able to walk that far.”

He looked over the rim of the teacup to see how this remark would be
taken—he felt excited all of a sudden at the thought that something was
going to be attempted that had not been attempted in many years, and a
feeling of misfortune took hold of him that he had certainly not felt at
Pauvla Agrippa’s death. Everything about the place, and his life that
had seemed to him quite normal and natural, now seemed strange.

The disrupting of one idea—that the horse could not be caught—put him
into a mood that made all other accustomed things alien.

However, after this it seemed quite natural that they should make the
effort and Tasha went into the room where Pauvla Agrippa lay.

The boy had fallen asleep in the corner and Pauvla’s baby was crawling
over him, making for Pauvla, cooing softly and saying “mamma” with
difficulty, because the little under-lip kept reaching to the upper lip
to prevent the saliva from interrupting the call.

Tasha put her foot in the baby’s way and stood looking down at Pauvla
Agrippa, where her small hands lay beneath her fine breast with its
purple veins, and now Tasha did not feel quite the same resentment that
she had felt earlier. It is true this body had done something
irrevocable to Pauvla Agrippa, but she also realized that she, Tasha,
must now do something to this body; it was the same with everything,
nothing was left as it was, something was always altering something
else. Perhaps it was an unrecognized law.

Pauvla Agrippa’s husband had gone out to see what could be done with the
mare, and now the neighbour came in, saying that it would not come in
over the sand, but that he—the husband—thought that it would walk toward
the headland, as it was wont.

“If you could only carry her out to it,” he said.

Tasha called in two of her brothers and woke up the one on the floor.
“Everything will be arranged for her comfort,” she said, “when we get
her up there.” They lifted Pauvla Agrippa up and her baby began to
laugh, asking to be lifted up also, and holding its little hands high
that it might be lifted, but no one was paying any attention to him,
because now they were moving his mother.

Pauvla Agrippa looked fine as they carried her, only her small hands
parted and deserted the clef where they had lain, dropping down upon the
shoulders of her brothers. Several children stood hand in hand watching,
and one or two villagers appeared who had heard from the neighbours what
was going on.

The mare had been induced to stand and someone had slipped a halter over
its neck for the first time in many years; there was a frightened look
in the one eye and the film that covered the other seemed to darken, but
it made no objection when they raised Pauvla Agrippa and placed her on
its back, tying her on with a fish net.

Then someone laughed, and the neighbour slapped his leg saying, “Look
what the old horse has come to—caught and burdened at last.” And he
watched the mare with small cruel eyes.

Pauvla Agrippa’s husband took the strap of the halter and began plodding
through the sand, the two boys on either side of the horse holding to
all that was left of Pauvla Agrippa. Tasha came behind, her hands
folded, praying now to this horse, still trying to find peace, but she
noticed with a little apprehension that the horse’s flanks had begun to
quiver, and that this quiver was extending to its ribs and from its ribs
to its forelegs.

Then she saw it turn a little, lifting its head. She called out to
Pauvla Agrippa’s husband who, startled with the movement and the cry,
dropped the rope.

The mare had turned toward the sea; for an instant it stood there,
quivering, a great thin, bony thing with crooked legs; its blind eyes
half covered with the black coarse lashes. Pauvla Agrippa with her head
thrown a bit back rested easily, it seemed, the plaits of her yellow
hair lying about her neck, but away from her face, because she was not
supported quite right; still she looked like some strange new sea animal
beneath the net that held her from falling.

Then without warning, no-man’s-mare jumped forward and plunged neck-deep
into the water.

A great wave came up, covered it, receded and it could be seen swimming,
its head out of the water, while Pauvla Agrippa’s loosened yellow hair
floated behind. No one moved. Another wave rose high, descended, and
again the horse was seen swimming with head up, and this time Pauvla
Agrippa’s hands were parted and lay along the water as though she were
swimming.

The most superstitious among them began crossing themselves, and one
woman dropped on her knees, rocking from side to side; and still no one
moved.

And this time the wave rose, broke and passed on, leaving the surface
smooth.

That night Tasha picked up Pauvla Agrippa’s sleepy boy and standing in
the doorway prayed to the sea, and this time she found comfort.

                         SIX SONGS OF KHALIDINE

                      _To the Memory of Mary Pyne_


           The flame of your red hair does crawl and creep
           Upon your body that denies the gloom
           And feeds upon your flesh as ’t would consume
           The cold precision of your austere sleep—
           And all night long I beat it back, and weep.

           It is not gentleness but mad despair
           That sets us kissing mouths, O Khalidine,
           Your mouth and mine, and one sweet mouth unseen
           We call our soul. Yet thick within our hair
           The dusty ashes that our days prepare.

           The dark comes up, my little love, and dyes
           Your fallen lids with stain of ebony,
           And draws a thread of fear ’tween you and me
           Pulling thin blindness down across our eyes—
           And far within the vale a lost bird cries.

           Does not the wind moan round your painted towers
           Like rats within an empty granary?
           The clapper lost, and long blown out to sea
           Your windy doves. And here the black bat cowers
           Against your clock that never strikes the hours.

           And now I say, has not the mountain’s base
           Here trembled long ago unto the cry
           “I love you, ah, I love you!” Now we die
           And lay, all silent, to the earth our face.
           Shall that cast out the echo of this place?

           Has not one in the dark funereal
           Heard foot-fall fearful, born of no man’s tread,
           And felt the wings of death, though no wing spread
           And on his cheek a tear, though no tear fell—
           And a voice saying without breath “Farewell!”




                                THE DOVE


  PERSONS:      │
    AMELIA      │_Sisters_
  BURGSON       │
    VERA BURGSON│                          〃

    THE DOVE—   │_A young girl living with the_ BURGSONS

  TIME—_Early morning_

  PLACE—_The_ BURGSON _Apartment, a long, low rambling affair at the top
        of a house in the heart of the city_.

_The decoration is garish, dealing heavily in reds and pinks. There is
an evident attempt to make the place look luxuriously sensual. The
furniture is all of the reclining type._

_The walls are covered with a striped paper in red and white. Only two
pictures are evident, one of the Madonna and child, and one of an early
English tandem race._

_There are firearms everywhere. Many groups of swords, ancient and
modern, are secured to the walls. A pistol or two lie in chairs, etc._

_There is only one door, which leads out into the back hall directly
back centre._

AMELIA BURGSON _is a woman rather over the normal in height, with large
braids of very yellow hair, done about a long face. She seems vitally
hysterical_.

VERA BURGSON _is small, thin and dark_.

THE DOVE _is a slight girl barely out of her teens; she is as delicate
as china with almost dangerously transparent skin. Her nose is
high-bridged and thin, her hands and feet are also very long and
delicate. She has red hair, very elegantly coiffured. When she moves_
[_seldom_] _the slightest line runs between her legs, giving her the
expectant waiting air of a deer._

_At the rising of the curtain_ THE DOVE, _gowned in white, is seated on
the divan polishing the blade of an immense sword. Half reclining to her
right lies_ VERA _in a thin yellow morning gown. A French novel has half
fallen from her hand. Her eyes are closed._


THE DOVE—Yes, I’m hurrying.

VERA—That’s best, she will be back soon.

THE DOVE—She is never gone long.

VERA—No, never very long—one would grow old waiting for the day on which
she would stay an hour—a whole hour.

THE DOVE—Yes, that’s true.

VERA—[_Wearily._] She says we live dangerously; [_laughs_] why, we can’t
even keep the flies out.

THE DOVE—Yes, there are a great many flies.

VERA—[_After a pause._] Shall I ever have a lover, do you suppose?

THE DOVE—[_Turning the sword over._] No, I suppose not.

VERA—Yet Amelia and I have made it our business to know—everything.

THE DOVE—Yes?

VERA—Yes. We say this little thing in French and that little thing in
Spanish, and we collect knives and pistols, but we only shoot our
buttons off with the guns and cut our darning cotton with the knives,
and we’ll never, never be perverse though our entire education has been
about knees and garters and pinches on hindquarters—elegantly bestowed—,
and we keep a few animals—very badly—hoping to see something
first-hand—and our beds are as full of yellow pages and French jokes as
a bird’s nest is full of feathers— God! [_she stands up abruptly_]
little one, why do I wear lace at my elbows?

THE DOVE—You have pretty arms.

VERA—Nonsense! Lace swinging back and forth like that, tickling my arms,
well, that’s not beauty——

THE DOVE—I know.

VERA—[_Returning to her couch._] I sometimes wonder what you do know,
you are such a strange happening, anyway. Well then, tell me what you
think of me and what you think of my sister, you have been here long
enough. Why do you stay? Do you love us?

THE DOVE—I love something that you have.

VERA—What?

THE DOVE—Your religious natures.

VERA—Good heavens!

THE DOVE—You misunderstand me. I call that imagination that is the
growth of ignorance, religion.

VERA—And why do you like that?

THE DOVE—Because it goes farther than knowledge.

VERA—You know, sometimes I wish——

THE DOVE—Yes?

VERA—That you had lived all we pretend we have.

THE DOVE—Why?

VERA—I don’t know, but somehow someone like you should know—everything.

THE DOVE—Do I seem so young?

VERA—I know, that’s what’s so odd. [_Impatiently._] For heaven’s sake,
will you stop polishing that infernal weapon!

THE DOVE—[_Quietly._] She said to me:

“Take all the blood stains off first, then polish it.”

VERA—There you are; she is quite mad, there’s no doubt. Blood stains!
Why, she would be afraid to cut her chops with it—and as for the rest of
her manifestations—nonsense!

THE DOVE—She carries a pistol with her, just to go around the corner for
a pound of butter.

VERA—It’s wicked! She keeps an enormous blunderbuss in the corner of her
room, but when I make up her bed, all I find is some Parisienne bathing
girl’s picture stuck full of pin holes——

THE DOVE—I know, she sits beside me for hours making those pin holes in
the borders of everything in sight.

VERA—[_With a strange anger._] Why do you stay?

THE DOVE—Why should I go?

VERA—I should think this house and two such advanced virgins as Amelia
and myself would drive you to despair——

THE DOVE—No, no, I’m not driven to despair——

VERA—What do you find here?

THE DOVE—I love Amelia.

VERA—Another reason for going away.

THE DOVE—Is it?

VERA—Yes, it is.

THE DOVE—Strange, I don’t feel that way about it.

VERA—Sometimes I think——

THE DOVE—Yes?

VERA—That you are the mad one, and that we are just eccentric.

THE DOVE—Yet my story is quite simple.

VERA—I’m not so certain.

THE DOVE—Yet you have heard it.

VERA—There’s more than one hears.

THE DOVE—I was born on a farm——

VERA—So you say.

THE DOVE—I became very fond of moles—it’s so daring of them to be in the
darkness underground. And then I like the open fields, too—they say
there’s nothing like nature for the simple spirit.

VERA—Yes, and I’ve long had my suspicions of nature.

THE DOVE—Be that as it may, my brothers were fond of me—in a way, and my
father in—a way—then I came to New York——

VERA—And took up the painting of china——

THE DOVE—Exactly. I was at that for three years, then one day I met you
walking through the park, do you remember? You had a parasol, you tipped
it back of your head, you looked at me a long time. Then I met Amelia,
by the same high fence in the same park, and I bowed to her in an almost
military fashion, my heels close together——

VERA—And you never did anything wild, insane——

THE DOVE—It depends on what you call wild, insane——

VERA—[_With great excitement._] Have you ever taken opium or hasheesh?

THE DOVE—[_As if answering._] There are many kinds of dreams—in one you
laugh, in another you weep——

VERA—[_Wringing her hands._] Yes, yes, once I dreamed. A dream in the
day, with my eyes wide open. I dreamt I was a Dresden doll and that I
had been blown down by the wind and that I broke all to pieces—that is,
my arms and my head broke all to pieces—but that I was surprised to find
that my china skirt had become flexible, as if it were made of chiffon
and lace.

THE DOVE—You see, there are many dreams——

VERA—Have you ever felt that your bones were utterly sophisticated but
that your flesh was keeping them from expressing themselves?

THE DOVE—Or vice versa?

VERA—Yes, or vice versa.

THE DOVE—There are many kinds of dreams——

VERA—You know, I’m afraid of you!

THE DOVE—Me?

VERA—Yes, you seem so gentle—do we not call you the Dove? And you are so
little—so little it’s almost immoral, you make me feel as if——

THE DOVE—As if?

VERA—Well, as if your terrible quality were not one of action, but just
the opposite, as if you wanted to prevent nothing.

THE DOVE—There are enough people preventing things, aren’t there?

VERA—Yes—that’s why you frighten me.

THE DOVE—Because I let everything go on, as far as it can go?

VERA—Yes, because you disturb nothing.

THE DOVE—I see.

VERA—You never meddle——

THE DOVE—No, I never meddle.

VERA—You don’t even observe as other people do, you don’t watch. Why, if
I were to come to you, wringing my hands saying, “Amelia has shot
herself,” I don’t believe you would stand up.

THE DOVE—No, I don’t suppose I would, but I would do something for all
that.

VERA—What?

THE DOVE—I should want to be very sure you wrung your hands as much as
possible, and that Amelia had gotten all there was to get out of the
bullet before she died.

VERA—It’s all very well, but why don’t you do something?

THE DOVE—A person who is capable of anything needs no practice.

VERA—You are probably maligning yourself, you are a gentle creature, a
very girl——

THE DOVE—If you were sensitive you would not say that.

VERA—Well, perhaps. [_She laughs a hard laugh._] What can you expect of
a lumber dealer’s daughter?

THE DOVE—Why are you so restless, Vera?

VERA—Because I’m a woman. I leave my life entirely to my imagination and
my imagination is terrific. I can’t even turn to religion for the
_prie-dieu_ inclines me to one thing only—so there you are!

THE DOVE—You imagine—many things?

VERA—You know well enough—sitting here day after day, giving my mind
everything to do, the body nothing——

THE DOVE—What do you want, Vera?

VERA—Some people would say a lover, but I don’t say a lover; some people
would say a home, but I don’t say a home. You see I have imagined myself
beyond the need of the usual home and beyond the reach of the usual
lover——

THE DOVE—Then?

VERA—Perhaps what I really want is a reason for using one of these
pistols! [_She laughs and lies back._ THE DOVE, _having risen, goes up
behind_ VERA _and places her hand on her throat_.]

THE DOVE—Now you may use one of those pistols.

VERA—[_Startled, but making no attempt to remove the_ DOVE’S _hand_.]
For such a _little_ thing?

THE DOVE—[_Dropping her hand, once more taking up her old position,
sword on knee._] Ah!

VERA—Why do you say that? [_She is evidently agitated._]

THE DOVE—I suppose I shall _always_ wait.

VERA—What is the matter?

THE DOVE—Always, always!

VERA—What _is_ the matter?

THE DOVE—I suppose I’m waiting for the person who will know that
anything is a reason for using a pistol, unless one is waiting for the
obvious, and the obvious has never been sufficient reason.

VERA—It’s all hopeless, I am hopeless and Amelia is hopeless, and as for
you—— [_She makes a gesture._]

THE DOVE—I’ve never held anything against hopelessness.

VERA—Now what do you mean?

THE DOVE—It doesn’t matter.

VERA—[_After a long pause._] I wish you danced.

THE DOVE—Perhaps I do.

VERA—It might make me happier.

THE DOVE—[_Irrelevantly._] Why don’t people get angry at each other,
quite suddenly and without reason?

VERA—Why should they?

THE DOVE—Isn’t there something fine and cold and detached about a
causeless anger?

VERA—I suppose so, it depends——

THE DOVE—No, it does not depend, that’s exactly it; to have a reason is
to cheapen rage. I wish every man were beyond the reach of his own
biography.

VERA—You are either quite an idiot, or a saint.

THE DOVE—I thought we had discussed that.

VERA—[_Dashed but not showing it._] Yes, a saint.

THE DOVE—[_Continuing._] I’m impatient of necessary continuity, I’m too
sensitive, perhaps. I want the beautiful thing to be, how can logic have
anything to do with it, or probable sequence?

VERA—You make my hair stand on end!

THE DOVE—Of course, that’s logical!

VERA—Then how is it you like Amelia? And how do you stand me?

THE DOVE—Because you are two splendid dams erected about two little
puddles.

VERA—You’re horrid!

THE DOVE—Only horrid!

VERA—Yes, I’m really afraid of you.

THE DOVE—Afraid?

VERA—For instance, when you’re out of this room all these weapons might
be a lot of butter knives or pop guns, but let you come in——

THE DOVE—Well?

VERA—It becomes an arsenal.

THE DOVE—Yet you call me the Dove.

VERA—Amelia called you the Dove, I’d never have thought of it. It’s just
like Amelia to call the only dangerous thing she ever knew the “Dove.”

THE DOVE—Yes, there’s something in that.

VERA—Shall I sing for you?

THE DOVE—If you like.

VERA—Or shall I show you the album that no one ever sees? [_She
laughs._] If we had any friends we would have to throw that book in the
fire.

THE DOVE—And you would have to clear the entry——

VERA—True. It’s because of that picture of the Venetian courtesans that
I send Amelia out for the butter, I don’t dare let the grocer call.

THE DOVE—You have cut yourselves off—just because you’re lonely.

VERA—Yes, just because we are lonely.

THE DOVE—It’s quite wonderful.

VERA—It’s a wonder the neighbours don’t complain of Amelia’s playing
that way on the violin.

THE DOVE—I had not noticed.

VERA—No, I presume not, but everyone else in the house has. No nice
woman slurs as many notes as Amelia does! [_At this moment_ AMELIA
_enters the outer room. She is wearing a cloak with three
shoulder-capes, a large plumed hat, and skirt with many flounces._]

AMELIA—[_From the entry._] You should come and see Carpaccio’s Deux
Courtisanes Vénitiennes now, the sun is shining right in on the head of
the one in the foreground. [_She begins to hum an Italian street song._]
Well, I have brought a little something and a bottle of wine. The wine
is for you, my Dove—and for you, Vera, I’ve a long green feather.
[_Pause in which_ THE DOVE _continues to polish the blade of the sword_.
VERA _has picked up her book_.]

AMELIA—[_Advancing into the room, shrugging._] It’s damp! [_Seeing_ THE
DOVE _still at work_.] What a sweet, gentle creature, what a little Dove
it is! Ah, God, it’s a sin, truly it’s a sin that I, a woman with
temperament, permit a young girl to stay in the same room with me!

THE DOVE—[_In a peaceful voice._] I’ve loaded all the pistols——

VERA—[_With suppressed anger._] Shined all the swords, ground all the
poniard points! Attack a man now if you dare, he’ll think you’re playing
with him!

AMELIA—[_In an awful voice._] Vera! [_She begins pacing._] Disaster!
disaster!—wherever I go, disaster! A woman selling fish tried to do me
out of a quarter and when I remonstrated with her, she said with a wink:
“I, too, have been bitten by the fox!”

THE DOVE—If you’ll sit down I’ll make some tea.

AMELIA—No, no, we’ll have a little lunch soon, only I never can get the
corks out of bottles.

THE DOVE—I can.

VERA—Rubbish! [_She gets up and goes out._]

AMELIA—Well, has anything happened since I went out?

THE DOVE—No.

AMELIA—No, no, it never does. [_She begins to walk about hurriedly._]
Aren’t there a great many flies in here?

THE DOVE—Yes, the screens should be put up.

AMELIA—No, no, no, I don’t want anything to be shut out. Flies have a
right to more than life, they have a right to be curious.

THE DOVE—A bat flew into the room last night.

AMELIA—[_Shuddering._] Some day I shall look like a bat, having beaten
my wings about every corner of the world, and never having hung over
anything but myself——

THE DOVE—And this morning, early, before you got up, the little
seamstress’ monkey walked in through the window——

AMELIA—[_Stopping short._] Are we to become infested?

THE DOVE—Yesterday the mail-man offered me some dancing mice, he’s
raising them.

AMELIA—[_Throwing up her hands._] There! You see! [_Pause._] Why should
I wear red heels? Why does my heart beat?

THE DOVE—Red heels are handsome.

AMELIA—Yes, yes, that’s what I say [_she begins to dance_]. Little one,
were you ever held in the arms of the one you love?

THE DOVE—Who knows?

AMELIA—If we had not been left an income we might have been in
danger—well, let us laugh [_she takes a few more dance steps_]. Eating
makes one fat, nothing more, and exercising reduces one, nothing more.
Drink wine—put flesh on the instep, the instep that used to tell such a
sweet story—and then the knees—fit for nothing but prayers! The
hands—too fat to wander! [_she waves her arm_]. Then one exercises, but
it’s never the same; what one has, is always better than what one
regains. Is it not so, my little one? But never mind, don’t answer. I’m
in an excellent humour—I could talk for hours, all about myself—to
myself, for myself. God! I’d like to tear out all the wires in the
house! Destroy all the tunnels in the city, leave nothing underground or
hidden or useful, oh, God, God! [_She has danced until she comes
directly in front of_ THE DOVE. _She drops on her knees and lays her
arms on either side of_ THE DOVE.] I hate the chimneys on the houses, I
hate the doorways, I hate you, I hate Vera, but most of all I hate my
red heels!

THE DOVE—[_Almost inaudibly._] Now, now!

AMELIA—[_In high excitement._] Give me the sword! It has been sharpened
long enough, give it to me, give it to me! [_She makes a blind effort to
find the sword; finding_ THE DOVE’S _hand instead, she clutches it
convulsively. Slowly_ THE DOVE _bares Amelia’s left shoulder and breast,
and leaning down, sets her teeth in. Amelia gives a slight, short
stifled cry. At the same moment_ VERA _appears in the doorway with the
uncorked bottle_. THE DOVE _stands up swiftly, holding a pistol. She
turns in the doorway hastily vacated by_ VERA.]

THE DOVE—So! [_She bows, a deep military bow, and turning goes into the
entry._]

THE VOICE OF THE DOVE—For the house of Burgson! [_A moment later a shot
is heard._]

AMELIA—[_Running after her._] Oh, my God!

VERA—What has she done?

AMELIA—[_Reappearing in the doorway with the picture of the Venetian
courtesans, through which there is a bullet hole—slowly, but with
emphasis._] _This_ is obscene!


                                CURTAIN




                                 MOTHER


A feeble light flickered in the pawn shop at Twenty-nine. Usually, in
the back of this shop, reading by this light—a rickety lamp with a
common green cover—sat Lydia Passova, the mistress.

Her long heavy head was divided by straight bound hair. Her high firm
bust was made still higher and still firmer by German corsets. She was
excessively tall, due to extraordinarily long legs. Her eyes were small,
and not well focused. The left was slightly distended from the long use
of a magnifying glass.

She was middle-aged, and very slow in movement, though well balanced.
She wore coral in her ears, a coral necklace, and many coral finger
rings.

There was about her jewelry some of the tragedy of all articles that
find themselves in pawn, and she moved among the trays like the
guardians of cemetery grounds, who carry about with them some of the
lugubrious stillness of the earth on which they have been standing.

She dealt, in most part, in cameos, garnets, and a great many inlaid
bracelets and cuff-links. There were a few watches however, and silver
vessels and fishing tackle and faded slippers—and when, at night, she
lit the lamp, these and the trays of precious and semi-precious stones,
and the little ivory crucifixes, one on either side of the window,
seemed to be leading a swift furtive life of their own, conscious of the
slow pacing woman who was known to the street as Lydia Passova.

No one knew her, not even her lover—a little nervous fellow, an
Englishman quick in speech with a marked accent, a round-faced youth
with a deep soft cleft in his chin, on which grew two separate tufts of
yellow hair. His eyes were wide and pale, and his eyeteeth prominent.

He dressed in tweeds, walked with the toes in, seemed sorrowful when not
talking, laughed a great deal and was nearly always to be found in the
café about four of an afternoon.

When he spoke it was quick and jerky. He had spent a great deal of his
time in Europe, especially the watering places—and had managed to get
himself in trouble in St. Moritz, it was said, with a well-connected
family.

He liked to seem a little eccentric and managed it simply enough while
in America. He wore no hat, and liked to be found reading the _London
Times_, under a park lamp at three in the morning.

Lydia Passova was never seen with him. She seldom left her shop,
however, she was always pleased when he wanted to go anywhere: “Go,” she
would say, kissing his hand, “and when you are tired come back.”

Sometimes she would make him cry. Turning around she would look at him a
little surprised, with lowered lids, and a light tightening of the
mouth.

“Yes,” he would say, “I know I’m trivial—well then, here I go, I will
leave you, not disturb you any longer!” and darting for the door he
would somehow end by weeping with his head buried in her lap.

She would say, “There, there—why are you so nervous?”

And he would laugh again: “My father was a nervous man, and my mother
was high-strung, and as for me——” He would not finish.

Sometimes he would talk to her for long hours, she seldom answering,
occupied with her magnifying glass and her rings, but in the end she was
sure to send him out with: “That’s all very true, I have no doubt; now
go out by yourself and think it over”—and he would go, with something
like relief, embracing her large hips with his small strong arms.

They had known each other a very short time, three or four months. He
had gone in to pawn his little gold ring, he was always in financial
straits, though his mother sent him five pounds a week; and examining
the ring, Lydia Passova had been so quiet, inevitable, necessary, that
it seemed as if he must have known her forever—“at some time,” as he
said.

Yet they had never grown together. They remained detached, and on her
part, quiet, preoccupied.

He never knew how much she liked him. She never told him; if he asked
she would look at him in that surprised manner, drawing her mouth
together.

In the beginning he had asked her a great many times, clinging to her,
and she moved about arranging her trays with a slight smile, and in the
end lowered her hand and stroked him gently.

He immediately became excited. “Let us dance,” he cried, “I have a great
capacity for happiness.”

“Yes, you are very happy,” she said.

“You understand, don’t you?” he asked abruptly.

“What?”

“That my tears are nothing, have no significance, they are just a
protective fluid—when I see anything happening that is about to affect
my happiness I cry, that’s all.”

“Yes,” Lydia Passova said, “I understand.” She turned around reaching up
to some shelves, and over her shoulder she asked, “Does it hurt?”

“No, it only frightens me. You never cry, do you?”

“No, I never cry.”

That was all. He never knew where she had come from, what her life had
been, if she had or had not been married, if she had or had not known
lovers; all that she would say was, “Well, you are with me, does that
tell you nothing?” and he had to answer, “No, it tells me nothing.”

When he was sitting in the café he often thought to himself, “There’s a
great woman”—and he was a little puzzled why he thought this because his
need of her was so entirely different from any need he seemed to
remember having possessed before.

There was no swagger in him about her, the swagger he had always felt
for his conquests with women. Yet there was not a trace of shame—he was
neither proud nor shy about Lydia Passova, he was something entirely
different. He could not have said himself what his feeling was—but it
was in no way disturbing.

People had, it is true, begun to tease him:

“You’re a devil with the ladies.”

Where this had made him proud, now it made him uneasy.

“Now, there’s a certain Lydia Passova for instance, who would ever have
thought——”

Furious he would rise.

“So, you do feel——”

He would walk away, stumbling a little among the chairs, putting his
hand on the back of every one on the way to the door.

Yet he could see that, in her time, Lydia Passova had been a “perverse”
woman—there was, about everything she did, an economy that must once
have been a very sensitive and a very sensuous impatience, and because
of this everyone who saw her felt a personal loss.

Sometimes, tormented, he would come running to her, stopping abruptly,
putting it to her this way:

“Somebody has said something to me.”

“When—where?”

“Now, in the café.”

“What?”

“I don’t know, a reproach——”

She would say:

“We are all, unfortunately, only what we are.”

She had a large and beautiful angora cat, it used to sit in the tray of
amethysts and opals and stare at her from very bright cold eyes. One day
it died, and calling her lover to her she said:

“Take her out and bury her.” And when he had buried her he came back,
his lips twitching.

“You loved that cat—this will be a great loss.”

“Have I a memory?” she inquired.

“Yes,” he answered.

“Well,” she said quietly, fixing her magnifying glass firmly in her eye.
“We have looked at each other, that is enough.”

And then one day she died.

The caretaker of the furnace came to him, where he was sipping his
liqueur as he talked to his cousin, a pretty little blond girl, who had
a boring and comfortably provincial life, and who was beginning to
chafe.

He got up, trembling, pale, and hurried out.

The police were there, and said they thought it had been heart failure.

She lay on the couch in the inner room. She was fully dressed, even to
her coral ornaments; her shoes were neatly tied—large bows of a ribbed
silk.

He looked down. Her small eyes were slightly open, the left, that had
used the magnifying glass, was slightly wider than the other. For a
minute she seemed quite natural. She had the look of one who is about to
say: “Sit beside me.”

Then he felt the change. It was in the peculiar heaviness of the
head—sensed through despair and not touch. The high breasts looked very
still, the hands were half closed, a little helpless, as in life—hands
that were too proud to “hold.” The drawn-up limb exposed a black
petticoat and a yellow stocking. It seemed that she had become hard—set,
as in a mould—that she rejected everything now, but in rejecting had
bruised him with a last terrible pressure. He moved and knelt down. He
shivered. He put his closed hands to his eyes. He could not weep.

She was an old woman, he could see that. The ceasing of that one thing
that she could still have for anyone made it simple and direct.

Something oppressed him, weighed him down, bent his shoulders, closed
his throat. He felt as one feels who has become conscious of passion for
the first time, in the presence of a relative.

He flung himself on his face, like a child.

That night, however, he wept, lying in bed, his knees drawn up.




                             SONG IN AUTUMN


           The wind comes down before the creeping night
           And you, my love, are hid within the green
           Long grasses; and the dusk steals up between
           Each leaf, as through the shadow quick with fright
           The startled hare leaps up and out of sight.

           The hedges whisper in their loaded boughs
           Where warm birds slumber, pressing wing to wing,
           All pulsing faintly, like a muted string
           Above us where we weary of our vows—
           And hidden underground the soft moles drowse.

[Illustration]




                               THE NIGGER


John Hardaway was dying. That wasn’t what he minded. His small,
well-shaped hands twitched at the soft coverlet which rose and fell
slowly with his breathing, and he breathed hard with mouth open, showing
all his teeth.

Rabb, the nigger, crouched in the corner. The air about her was heavy
with her odour. She kept blinking her eyes. She was awed at the presence
of her master, but ashamed too, ashamed that he was dying—ashamed as she
would have been had he been caught at his toilet.

Rabb was a good nigger; she had served John Hardaway’s mother, she had
seen her die—old Mrs. Hardaway fluttered against her lace like a bird
caught in deep foliage—Rabb had been able to do something about Mrs.
Hardaway’s death because Mrs. Hardaway had loved her, in her way.

Mrs. Hardaway had died understandably—she had breathed hard too, opening
her mouth, but it was gentle and eager, like a child at the breast.

Rabb had tried to be near her, had put her hands on her. But the thing
she was trying to touch lay in some hidden corner of Mrs. Hardaway, as a
cat hides away under a bed, and Rabb had done nothing after all.

But it was different with John Hardaway. She watched life playing
coquettishly with him. It played with him as a dog plays with an old
coat. It shook him suddenly in great gusts of merriment. It played with
his eyelids; it twisted his mouth, it went in and out of his body, like
a flame running through a funnel—throwing him utterly aside in the end,
leaving him cold, lonely, and forbidding.

John Hardaway hated negroes with that hate a master calls love. He was a
Southerner and never forgot it. Rabb had nursed him when he was an
infant, she had seen him grow up into a big boy, and then she had been
there when he broke his mistress’s back by some flaw in his otherwise
flawless passion.

From time to time John Hardaway called for water. And when Rabb tried to
lift his head, he cursed her for a ‘black bitch’—but in the end he had
to let her hold it.

John Hardaway was fifty-nine, he had lived well, scornfully, and this
always makes the end easier; he had been a gentleman in the only way a
Southerner has of being one—he never forgot that he was a Hardaway——

He called out to her now:

“When I die—leave the room.”

“Yes, sah,” she whispered sadly.

“Bring me the broth.”

She brought it trembling. She was very tired and very hungry, and she
wanted to whistle but she only whispered:

“Ain’t there nothing I kin do for you?”

“Open the window.”

“It’s night air, sah——”

“Open it, fool——”

She went to the window and opened it. She was handsome when she reached
up, and her nose was almost as excellent as certain Jewish noses; her
throat was smooth, and it throbbed.

Toward ten o’clock that night John Hardaway began to sing to himself. He
was fond of French, but what he learned in French he sang in English.

  “Ah, my little one—I have held you on my knee——

  “I have kissed your ears and throat——

  “Now I set you down——

  “You may do as you will.”

He tried to turn over—but failed, and so he lay there staring into the
fire.

At this point in the death of John Hardaway, Rabb, the nigger, came out
of her corner, and ceased trembling. She was hungry and began heating
some soup in a saucepan.

“What are you doing?” John Hardaway inquired abruptly.

“I’s hungry, sah.”

“Then get out of here—get into the kitchen.”

“Yes, sah,” but she did not move.

John Hardaway breathed heavily, a mist went over his eyes—presently,
after interminable years, he lifted his lids. Rabb was now slowly
sipping the steaming soup.

“You damned nigger!”

She got up from her haunches hurriedly—placing her hand in front of her,
backing toward the door.

“Little one, I have taken you on my knee——”

Rabb crept back—she came up to the bed.

“Massah, don’t you think——?”

“What?”

“A priest—maybe?”

“Fool!”

“Yes, sah, I only wanted to make safe.”

He tried to laugh. He pressed his knees together. He had forgotten her.

Finally toward dawn he began to wander.

Rabb moistened the roll of red flesh inside her lip and set her teeth.
She began to grin at nothing at all, stroking her hips.

He called to her.

“I want to tell you something.”

She came forward—rolling her eyes.

“Come closer.”

She came.

“Lean down!” She leaned down, but already the saliva began to fill her
mouth.

“Are you frightened?”

“No, sah,” she lied.

He raised his hand but it fell back, feebly. “Keep your place,” he
whispered, and instantly went to sleep.

He began to rattle in his throat, while Rabb crouched in the corner,
holding her breasts in her folded arms and rocking softly on the balls
of her feet.

The rattling kept on. Rabb began creeping toward him on hands and knees.

“Massah!”

He did not move.

“John!”

He felt a strange sensation—he lifted his eyelids with their fringe of
white lashes and almost inaudibly said:

“Now go!”

He had closed his eyes a long time, when he was troubled with the
thought that someone was trying to get into his body as he left it. He
opened his eyes and there stood Rabb the nigger very close, looking down
at him.

A gush of blood sprang from his nose.

“No, sah!”

He began to gasp. Rabb the nigger stood up to her full height and looked
down at him. She began to fan him, quickly. He breathed more hurriedly,
his chest falling together like a house of cards. He tried to speak, he
could not.

Suddenly Rabb bent down and leaning her mouth to his, breathed into him,
one great and powerful breath. His chest rose, he opened his eyes, said
“Ah!” and died.

Rabb ran her tongue along her lips, and raising her eyes, stared at a
spot on the wall a little higher than she was wont to. After a while she
remembered her unfinished soup.




                                LULLABY


         When I was a young child I slept with a dog,
         I lived without trouble and I thought no harm;
         I ran with the boys and I played leap-frog;
         Now it is a girl’s head that lies on my arm.

         Then I grew a little, picked plantain in the yard;
         Now I dwell in Greenwich, and the people do not call;
         Then I planted pepper-seed and stamped on them hard.
         Now I am very quiet and I hardly plan at all.

         Then I pricked my finger on a thorn, or a thistle,
         Put the finger in my mouth, and ran to my mother.
         Now I lie here, with my eyes on a pistol.
         There will be a morrow, and another, and another.




                             INDIAN SUMMER


At the age of fifty-three Madame Boliver was young again. She was
suddenly swept away in a mad current of reckless and beautiful youth.
What she had done with those years that had counted up into such a
perfect conclusion, she could not tell—it was a strange, vague dream.
She had been plain, almost ugly, shy, an old maid. She was tall and
awkward—she sat down as if she were going to break when she was in those
new years that girls call early bloom.

When she was thirty she had been frankly and astonishingly Yankee; she
came toward one with an erect and angular stride. She was severe, silent
and curious. It was probably due to this that she was called Madame. She
dressed in black outlined with white collar and cuffs, her hair was
drawn straight back and showed large lobed and pale ears. The tight
drawn hair exposed her features to that utter and unlovely nakedness
that some clean rooms are exposed to by the catching back of heavy and
melancholy curtains—she looked out upon life with that same unaccustomed
and expectant expression that best rooms wear when thrown open for the
one yearly festivity that proclaims their owners well to do.

She had no friends and could not keep acquaintances—her speech was
sharp, quick and truthful. She spoke seldom, but with such fierce
strictness and accuracy that those who came into contact with her once,
took precautions not to be thus exposed a second time.

She grew older steadily and without regret—long before the age of thirty
she had given up all expectations of a usual life or any hopes of that
called “unusual”; she walked in a straight path between the two, and she
was content and speculated little upon this thing in her that had made
her unloved and unlovely.

Her sisters had married and fallen away about her as blossoms are
carried off, leaving the stalk—their children came like bits of pollen
and she enjoyed them and was mildly happy. Once she, too, had dreamed of
love, but that was before she had attained to the age of seventeen—by
that time she knew that no one could or would ask for her hand—she was
plain and unattractive and she was satisfied.

She had become at once the drudge and the adviser—all things were laid
upon her both to solve and to produce. She laboured for others easily
and willingly and they let her labour.

At fifty-three she blazed into a riotous Indian Summer of loveliness.
She was tall and magnificent. She carried with her a flavour of some
exotic flower; she exhaled something that savoured of those excellences
of odour and tone akin to pain and to pleasure; she lent a plastic
embodiment to all hitherto unembodied things. She was like some rare
wood, carved into a melting form—she breathed abruptly as one who has
been dead for half a century.

Her face, it is true, was not that plump, downy and senseless
countenance of the early young—it was thin and dark and marked with a
few very sensitive wrinkles; about the mouth there were signs of a
humour she had never possessed, of a love she had never known, of a joy
she had never experienced and of a wisdom impossible for her to have
acquired. Her still, curious eyes with their blue-white borders and the
splendid irises were half veiled by strange dusty lids. The hair, that
had once been drawn back, was still drawn back, but no appallingly
severe features were laid bare. Instead the hair seemed to confer a
favour on all those who might look upon its restrained luxury, for it
uncovered a face at once valuable and unusual.

Her smile was rich in colour—the scarlet of her gums, the strange
whiteness of her teeth, the moisture of the sensitive mouth, all seemed
as if Madame Boliver were something dyed through with perfect and rare
life.

Now when she entered a room everyone paused, looking up and speaking
together. She was quite conscious of this and it pleased her—not because
she was too unutterably vain, but because it was so new and so
unexpected.

For a while her very youth satisfied her—she lived with herself as
though she were a second person who had been permitted access to the
presence of some lovely and some longed-for dream.

She did not know what to do. If she could have found religion newly with
her new youth she would have worshipped and have been profoundly glad of
the kneeling down and the rising up attendant with faith, but this was a
part of her old childhood and it did not serve.

She had prayed then because she was ugly; she could not pray now because
she was beautiful—she wanted something new to stand before, to speak to.

One by one the old and awkward things went, leaving in their wake
Venetian glass and bowls of onyx, silks, cushions and perfume. Her books
became magazines with quaint, unsurpassable and daring illustrations.

Presently she had a salon. She was the rage. Gentlemen in political
whiskers, pomaded and curled, left their coats in the embrace of pompous
and refined footmen.

Young students with boutonnières and ambitions came; an emissary or two
dropped in, proffered their hearts and departed. Poets and musicians,
littérateurs and artists experimenting in the modern, grouped themselves
about her mantels like butterflies over bonbons and poured sentiment
upon sentiment into her ears.

Several gentlemen of leisure and millions courted her furiously with
small tears in the corners of their alert eyes. Middle-aged professors
and one deacon were among the crowd that filled her handsome apartment
on those days when she entertained.

There was something about Madame Boliver that could not quite succumb to
herself. She was still afraid; she would start, draw her hand away and
pale abruptly in the middle of some ardent proposal—she would hurry to
the mirror at such times, though she never turned her head to look in.

Was it possible that she was beautiful now? And if so, would it remain?
And her heart said, “Yes, it will remain,” until at last she believed
it.

She put the past behind her and tried to forget it. It hurt her to
remember it, as if it were something that she had done in a moment of
absent-mindedness and of which she had to be ashamed. She remembered it
as one remembers some small wrong deed hidden for years. She thought
about her past unattractiveness as another would have thought of some
cruelty. Her eyes watered when she remembered her way of looking at
herself in her twenties. Her mouth trembled when she thought back to its
severity and its sharp retorts.

Her very body reproached her for all that had been forced upon it in her
other youth, and a strange passion came upon her, turning her memory of
her sisters into something at times like that hatred felt by the
oppressed who remember the oppression when it has given way to plenty.

But now she was free. She expanded, she sang, she dreamed for long
hours, her elbows upon the casement, looking out into the garden. She
smiled, remembering the old custom of serenading, and wondered when she,
too, would know it.

That she was fifty-three never troubled her. It never even occurred to
her. She had been fifty-three long ago at twenty, and now she was twenty
at fifty-three, that was all—this was compensation, and if she had been
through her middle age in youth she could go through her youth in middle
age.

At times she thought how much more beautiful nature is in its
treacheries than its remedies.

Those who hovered about her offered, time on time, to marry her, to
carry her away into Italy or to Spain, to lavish money and devotion on
her, and in the beginning she had been almost too ready to accept them
in their assurances, because the very assurances were so new and so
delightful.

But in spite of it she was, somewhere beneath her youth, old enough to
know that she did not love as she would love, and she waited with a
patience made pleasant by the constant attentions of the multitude.

And then Petkoff, “the Russian,” had come, accompanied by one of the
younger students.

A heavy fur cap came down to the borders of his squinting and piercing
eyes. He wore a mixture of clothing that proclaimed him at once foreign
and poor. His small moustache barely covered sensitive and well shaped
lips, and the little line of hair that reached down on each side of his
close-set ears gave him an early period expression as if he, too, in
spite of his few years, might have lived in the time when she was a
girl.

He could not have been much over thirty, perhaps just thirty—he said
little but never took his eyes off the object of his interest.

He spoke well enough, with an occasional lapse into Russian, which was
very piquant. He swept aside all other aspirants with his steady and
centred gaze. He ignored the rest of the company so completely as to rob
him of rudeness. If one is ignorant of the very presence of his fellow
beings, at most he can only be called “strange.”

Petkoff was both an ambitious and a self-centred man—all his qualities
were decisive and not hesitatingly crooked, providing he needed
crookedness to win his point. He was attractive to Madame Boliver
because he was as strange as she was herself, her youth was foreign, and
so was Petkoff.

He had come to this country to start a venture that promised to be
successful; in the meantime, he had to be careful both in person and in
heart.

What he felt for Madame Boliver was at first astonishment that such a
woman was still unmarried; he knew nothing of her past, and guessed at
her age much below the real figure. After a while this astonishment gave
way to pleasure and then to real and very sincere love.

He began to pay court to her, neglecting his business a little and
worrying over that end of it, but persisting, nevertheless.

He could see that she, on her side, was becoming deeply attached to him.
He would walk about in the park for hours arguing this affair out to
himself. Both the shoulds and should nots.

It got him nowhere except into a state of impatience. He liked clear-cut
acts and he could not decide to go or stay. As it was, nothing could be
worse for his business than this same feverish indecision. He made up
his mind.

Madame Boliver was radiantly happy. She began to draw away from a life
of entertainment and, instead, turned most of her energies into the
adoration of her first real love. She accepted him promptly, and with a
touch of her old firm and sharp decisiveness, and a hint of her utter
frankness. He told her that she took him as she would have taken a piece
of cake at a tea party, and they both laughed.

That was in the Winter. Madame Boliver was fifty-five—he never asked her
how old she was and she never thought to tell him. They set the day for
their wedding early in the following June.

They were profoundly happy. One by one the younger, more ardent admirers
fell off, but very slowly; they turned their heads a little as they
went, being both too vain and too skeptical to believe that this would
last.

She still held receptions and still her rooms were flooded, but when
Petkoff entered, a little better dressed but still a bit heedless of the
throng, they hushed their highest hilarities and spoke of the new novels
and the newest trend in art.

Petkoff had taken notice of them to that degree necessary to a man who
knows what he has won, and from whom and how many. He looked upon them
casually, but with a hint of well-being.

Madame Boliver grew more beautiful, more radiant, more easeful. Her
movements began to resemble flowing water; she was almost too happy, too
supple, too conscious of her well-being. She became arrogant, but still
splendid; she became vain, but still gracious; she became accustomed to
herself, but still reflective. She could be said to have bloomed at too
auspicious an age; she was old enough to appreciate it, and this is a
very dangerous thing.

She spent hours at the hair dresser’s and the dressmaker’s. Her dressing
table resembled a battlefield. It supported all the armament for keeping
age at a distance. She rode in the avenue in an open carriage, and
smiled when the society notices mentioned her name and ran her picture.

She finally gave one the impression of being beautiful, but too
conscious of it; talented, but too vain; easy of carriage, but too
reliant on it; of being strange and rare and wonderful, but a little too
strange, a little too rare, a little too wonderful. She became
magnificently complex to outward appearances, yet in her soul Madame
Boliver still kept her honesty, her frankness and her simplicity.

And then one day Madame Boliver took to her bed. It began with a
headache and ended with severe chills. She hoped to get up on the
following day, and she remained there a week; she put her party off,
expecting to be able to be about, but instead she gave it sitting in a
chair supported by cushions.

Petkoff was worried and morose. He had given a good deal of time to
Madame Boliver, and he cared for her in a selfish and all-engrossing
way. When she stood up no longer he broke a Venetian tumbler by throwing
it into the fireplace. When she laughed at this he suddenly burst out
into very heavy weeping. She tried to comfort him, but he would not be
comforted. She promised him that she would walk soon, as a mother
promises a child some longed-for object. When she said, “I will be well,
dear, soon; after all I’m a young woman,” he stopped and looked at her
through a film of painful tears.

“But are you?” he said, voicing for the first time his inner fear.

And it was then that the horror of the situation dawned upon her. In
youth, when youth comes rightly, there is old age in which to lose it
complacently, but when it comes in old age there is no time to watch it
go.

She sat up and stared at him.

“Why, yes,” she said in a flat and firm voice, “that’s so. I am no
longer of few years.”

She could not say “no longer young,” because she was young.

“It will make no difference.”

“Ah,” she said, “it will make no difference to you, but it will make a
difference to us.”

She lay back and sighed, and presently she asked him to leave her a
little while.

When he had gone she summoned the doctor.

She said: “My friend—am I dying—so soon?”

He shook his head emphatically. “Of course not,” he assured her; “we
will have you up in a week or so.”

“What is it, then, that keeps me here now?”

“You have tired yourself out, that is all. You see, such extensive
entertaining, my dear madame, will tax the youngest of us.” He shook his
head at this and twisted his moustache. She sent him away also.

The next few days were happy ones. She felt better. She sat up without
fatigue. She was joyful in Petkoff’s renewed affections. He had been
frightened, and he lavished more extravagant praise and endearing terms
on her than ever before. He was like a man who, seeing his fortune go,
found how dear it was to him after all and how necessary when it
returned to him. By almost losing her he appreciated what he should have
felt if he had lost her indeed.

It got to be a joke between them that they had held any fears at all. At
the club he beat his friends on the back and cried:

“Gentlemen, a beautiful and young woman.” And they used to beat his
back, exclaiming: “Lucky, by God!”

She ordered a large stock of wine and cakes for the wedding party,
bought some new Venetian glasses and indulged in a few rare old carpets
for the floor. She had quite a fancy, too, for a new gown offered at a
remarkably low sum, but she began to curb herself, for she had been very
extravagant as it was.

And then one day she died.

Petkoff came in a wild, strange mood. Four candles were burning at head
and feet, and Madame Boliver was more lovely than ever. Stamping, so
that he sent up little spirals of dust from the newly acquired carpet,
Petkoff strode up and down beside the bier. He leaned over and lit a
cigarette by one of the flickering flames of the candles. Madame
Boliver’s elderly sister, who was kneeling, coughed and looked
reproachfully upward at the figure of Petkoff, who had once again
forgotten everyone and everything. “Damn it!” he said, putting his
fingers into his vest.




                        I’D HAVE YOU THINK OF ME


            As one who, leaning on the wall, once drew
            Thick blossoms down, and hearkened to the hum
            Of heavy bees slow rounding the wet plum,
            And heard across the fields the patient coo
            Of restless birds bewildered with the dew.

            As one whose thoughts were mad in painful May,
            With melancholy eyes turned toward her love,
            And toward the troubled earth whereunder throve
            The chilly rye and coming hawthorn spray—
            With one lean, pacing hound, for company.




                               THE RABBIT


The road was covered with red and yellow leaves. Rugo Amietieve, who
said that he was an Armenian, had wished one of those lingering
good-byes to this rotund and plentiful day that only a man of slow and
methodical mind can bring into being. He bid it adieu with more than the
silence and the love of his heart; he had whispered over it, his square
yellow teeth a little apart and touching the moist curve of his
under-lip with the small round point of flesh that clung to his upper
like a tear. He said good-bye resolutely and quite peacefully, with the
restraint of a man who knows what’s bad for him and why. Rugo did not
want to leave the country, but he had to. He knew why he did not want
to, and he knew why he was being forced to—necessity—that was it,
necessity had been hurrying his people about the world from the
beginning of time and would hurry them.

Farewell held no piquancy for him, he did not tear out his heart by his
departure; there was nothing in the fact of the sunlight and the blowing
and dying leaves that gave him sweet pain and too heavy sorrow; the red
of the fallen apples sent no pang into the very midst of his being. On
the contrary Rugo Amietieve felt only that sense of loss that a good
housewife feels when she is letting a rich quilt out of her fingers. In
the soil, as Rugo had known it, had been life, hard and fragrant. He had
toiled at the plough grumbling, but sensing, with a slow, precise
pleasure, that the air was warm and good and healthy. He had tended his
geese and his cows with the same stolid satisfaction, and he watched
them moving about, leaning on his two folded and brown hands. The ducks’
yellow, gaping mouths gave him physical pleasure, he would have liked to
press his hand over them where they were all shining and brittle; it
would have given him as much pleasure as a flower petal—more, because
these living things that cackled and spread their wings and brought
forth young were profitable also—the world lived here and moved, and its
incidental placing of him where he could profit by it was the thing that
amazed and satisfied him.

Now it was otherwise. He must go away into the city where, they said,
nothing was fresh and new and living. His uncle had died, leaving him
his little tailoring establishment on the East Side. There Rugo was
bound, there from this day forward he would sit and sew interminably as
though he were a machine—as though he had suddenly died and had to work.

He lifted his straight nose and smelled the September air. Here the
woods dipped over the road, spilling shadows gigantic and restless, with
a speckling of ragged sun patches like flowers. Mosquitoes came up from
the swamp as the night descended and sang about Rugo’s ears and set him
swearing. They got into the long, tangled meshes of his beard and clung
there; they sat in among these thick, ruddy strands and hissed against
the shuddering flesh of his cheeks. He lifted one of his hands and
struck his face on either side, and went on.

The next morning the East Side, in the early Thirties, saw a stranger
sweeping out what had been old Amietieve’s shop. Rugo looked about him
with sad eyes. The room was twelve feet by twenty-four and the back part
was curtained off by a hanging of dull green, sprinkled over with pink
roses; a small cot bed was thus hidden from the front of the shop. It
was within these four walls that Rugo must live. He turned around in it,
sniffing the air with his long nose, laid back again as he had done in
the last hour in the country. He sneered. “You’re a little fool room,”
he said, “to be so small.” It was as if he were shaking it, as a child
is shaken and held up to learn by another’s larger and more important
example. He held this room up by the scruff of its neck and shook it in
the face of the thirty acres he had known, and he sneered upon it.

He had learned the trade when still a child, when this same uncle had
been guardian, but his fingers were freedom clumsy and he broke the
needle.

Work came hesitatingly and painfully. Rugo was a slow man, and at this
task he was still more laborious and backward. He toiled far into the
night seated upon his table, his goose between his knees. People walking
by on their way home sometimes peered in over the top of the cardboard
sign specked by the flies and the open fashion book with its strange,
angular, shiny gentlemen carrying canes and looking over their shoulders
playfully as if they were keeping something very amusing in their minds
to hand out like favours; and such people often said, “That chap will
die of consumption, you see.”

The butcher’s shop across the way seemed to be vying with the remnants
of silks and serge in Rugo’s window. There were rump ends and flanks and
knuckle bones, remnants of some fine animal, all wonderful and red and
satiny yellow where the layers of fat crept out like frostings, or where
fat spread over kidneys like irregular lace; yet to Rugo they were
somehow painful, they made him think of the cows and the poultry that he
had so often gazed fondly upon, of the animal life he had grown up
among, and he turned his head away and went on stitching.

Rugo got his own breakfast, lunch, dinner. Behind the curtain there,
beside his bed, was a small gas stove. In the Winter the shop was deadly
with heavy air. He could not open the door or he would have flooded the
place in a moment with cold, piercing and cruel, so he sat in the foul
air of a gas burner, and his eyes grew so dark in the paling face that
the children of the neighbourhood called him “Coal Eye.”

In the Summer business had picked up, though Rugo seldom had any time to
himself. He worked quicker, but then orders were more plentiful on
patches, turnings and pressings. He had become attached to a small, ill
and very slender Italian girl who came once with her father’s coat.

Her straight parted dark hair made him think of animals, he thought her
gentle and Madonna-like, not taking into account a small, cruel and
avaricious mouth. It was very red and he was pleased with it. Almost
anything bright pleased him. The very fact that these lips were cruel
pleased him, though he did not know that it was the brightness of
calculation that made them attractive to him.

Rugo was not a good-looking man, but this did not trouble him; he was as
good-looking as anyone he had ever seen, and therefore he was
unconscious that for so large a head, his body was rather small.

This girl Addie told him. It hurt him, because he was beginning to like
her. He noticed that when his lip trembled her eyes got very bright.
“Why,” he asked her, puzzled, “do you always look so pretty when you say
things like that?”

This flattered her, but it only made it worse for Rugo. She was indeed a
very common woman, with a little to make her young and pretty, and she
made the most of it.

Finally he spoke to her quietly and slowly about love and marriage. Of
course Addie, in her shrewd mind, had calculated on this; his was a
business that threatened to prosper, and she was attracted to him,
anyway. She made her plans accordingly; she acted displeased.

“You are a poor, common tradesman,” she said bitterly, as if she were
something uncommon and therefore beyond him. He felt this, too, and
instead of discovering her own smallness in the retort, he only got the
point she wanted him to get. He began to think himself below her. He
raised his hand:

“What do you want that I shall do?”

She shrugged her narrow shoulders and laughed, showing a red tongue that
seemed to crouch in her mouth in a long, dented line.

“But I must do something, you say I am only——”

“You shall never be anything else.”

“True, but I may be more.”

“Hardly.”

“Why do you say ‘hardly’?”

“You are not the sort of person—now, for instance——”

“Yes?” he questioned slowly, turning around and looking into her face.

“Well, for instance, you are hardly a hero.”

“Are heroes the style?” he asked pitifully. This made her laugh even
harder.

“Not in your family, I take it.”

He nodded. “Yes, that’s true—we were always quiet people. You do not
like quiet people?”

“They are like women,” she answered.

He pondered awhile over this. He shook his head; after all he knew
better and he was angry because he had been letting Addie lie to him.

“That is not true.”

She began to scream at him:

“So, that’s the way you begin, calling me a liar, is it?” She put her
hands into her hair on either side and tore at it. This had even more of
an effect upon Rugo than she had expected. He beat his hands together.
In spoiling the perfect oval of her head, in ruinously shaking its
smooth and parted hair, she had hurt him as much as if she had shaken a
holy picture.

“No, no,” he cried. “I will do something, you shall see—it is all
right—it is all right.” He approached her and, touching her shoulder
with his hand, he added:

“For you I will do it—I will do it.”

She smiled. “You will do what, Rugo Amietieve?”

“I shall be less like a woman. You called me like a woman; well, you
shall see.”

She came close to him, her two thin arms pressed close to her side.

“You will do something big and grand—Rugo—for me?”

He looked down at her, puzzled and quiet. The cruel mouth was half open,
showing the shining line of her teeth. He nodded, but this time he moved
away from her and stood staring out into the street.

She came up behind him, caught both of his hands, and, leaning forward,
kissed him on the back of his neck. He tried to turn, but she held his
two hands a moment longer and then broke out of the shop at a run.

Presently he set to work again, sitting cross-legged on his table.

He wondered what he was expected to do. He had often spoken to her of
returning to the country, with a hint in his voice that she would be
there beside him, too. Now it had come to this.

He pondered. A hero—what was a hero—what made the difference between a
hero and himself, anyway? He remembered tales the gypsies had told him
about their greatest men when he had been in the old land of his birth.
They told a story of a lad who fought and fought, and finding himself
unequal to the task of killing his rival, flung himself off a mountain.

What would be the use of that—he would die, and then he might as well
not have lived. He thought of all the great people he had read of, or
had heard of, or had known. There was Jean the blacksmith, who had lost
an eye saving his child from a horse. If he lost an eye Addie would not
like him.

Napoleon—there was a well-known man; he had done so many things, it
seemed, for which people framed him in white enamel and hung him upon
their bedroom walls; but chiefly he had been renowned for his killing.
Rugo thought about that awhile and came to the illuminating conclusion
that all heroes were men who killed or were killed.

Well, the last was impossible; if he was killed he might just as well
have starved in the country and not have laid eyes on Addie. Therefore,
he must kill—but what—but whom?

Of course, he might save something or somebody, but they would have to
be in danger first, and there might not be any danger for days and days,
and he was tired of waiting.

Presently he laid his work aside, lowered the shade, and, lying face
down on his bed, he tried to think it all out clearly.

Presently he got a vivid picture of killing in his mind. He sat up and
put his hands two or three times over his face. It was damp. He sat on
the edge of the bed and looked at the carpet. His mind wandered. He
thought of the ducks he had longed to stroke, of the gentle, feeding
cows, of the fresh, clean air—then he thought again of Addie and of what
he must do. He tried to picture himself killing someone. He put his two
hands together and looked at them—there, that was the way. Then he
smiled. His hands, set as they were, could not have choked anything
larger than a thrush. He widened them, but he separated them instantly
and rubbed them down his legs, breathing heavily. What a terrible
business a hero’s was! He thought of the throbbing that must stop
beneath such hands as his. He got up, shaking his shoulders from side to
side as if his back hurt him. He pulled up the shade.

The butcher’s windows opposite attracted his attention. Two gas lights
were burning there vividly. Rugo could see flanks of beef laid out in
pans, little ruddy pools collecting about them like insertion. Fowl hung
by the necks and several hams lured the passer-by as they swung softly
this way and that.

He opened his door hesitatingly and shutting it carefully stepped out
into the roadway.

He crossed over and leaned his head against the glass. He looked in very
close now, and he could see the film that shrouded the dead eyes of the
fowl and the hares. Slabs of liver laid out in heaps, flanked by cuts of
tripe, drew his attention.

A strange sensation had hold of him in the pit of his stomach. It seemed
to him that he was turning pale. He raised his hand to his beard and
tugged at it.

Two or three red hairs separated and came out. He held them up between
him and the light. Then he darted in the back door of the shop.

Presently he emerged carrying a box. With the furtive and hurried step
of a man who is being observed he crossed the street. He opened the door
of his own little shop and, locking it quickly, he put the box in the
corner and turned down the light.

It was very dark and he stumbled. A little reflection came from the meat
shop window and touched the rims of his cardboards, and his pattern book
full of the funny strutting gentlemen. His heart was beating horribly
against his side. He began to question himself and stopped. He could
never do it unless he made his mind a resolute thing. He clenched his
teeth, blinking his eyes as he did so. He began to shiver.

Presently he threw himself on the ground in the corner near the box, his
arms over his head, his face flat upon the dust and grime of the boards.
He must do it quickly—but he couldn’t do it.

His mind began to wander again. He thought of the road, red and yellow
with the dying leaves of Autumn, of the great swaying shadows and the
sunlight breaking in between in little jagged spots like flowers. He
remembered the mosquitoes, and he got to his knees and let his hands
hang down at his sides.

The Summer had always been so pretty; the rains left the fields so
bright and sudden when they came into view over the top of the hill. The
ploughing had been good, he had really enjoyed that after all, only then
he had not known just how much he did enjoy it. What a pity that he had
not known what a good thing it all was then.

Something moved beside him, breathing softly. He uttered a sharp cry and
the same thing moved back, hitting a board, and was again silent.

He bent forward, thrust his two hands out, closed them—tighter, tighter
and tighter. A faint cry, a little jerking to and fro—that was all.

He stood up and turned the light on. He looked at his hands. Then
backing away from the corner, never letting his eyes rest there, he
plunged his hands up to the elbows in a pail of water. He threw a cupful
of it inside his shirt at the neck. He opened the door. Addie was there.

She came in softly, gently, insinuatingly. She could see by his face
that something very horrible and necessary had been done. She saw by his
face how it had hurt, by his hands what it must have cost him.

She came close to him. “What have you done, Rugo?” she said.

“I—I have killed,” he said, almost in a whisper.

“What—where?” She moved toward the centre of the room and then looked
into the corner.

“That?” she began to laugh.

“Take it or leave it,” he said suddenly in a loud and penetrating voice.

She stooped and lifted it up—a small grey rabbit.

She laid it down again. She placed her arm about him.

“Come quickly,” she said. “Comb your hair.”

She pushed him into the street. She was afraid of him, for there was
something strange and hard in his mouth and he walked putting each foot
down very flat and steady.

“Where are you going? What are you going to do?” He did not seem to know
that she was there, clinging to him, her arm about his waist. He had
forgotten her. He looked up into the air, sniffing it and smiling.

“Come,” she said, “we are going to have your boots shined.”




                          THE FLOWERING CORPSE


             So still she lies in this closed place apart,
             Her feet grown fragile for the ghostly tryst;
             Her pulse no longer striking in her wrist,
             Nor does its echo wander through her heart.

             Over the body and the quiet head
             Like stately ferns above an austere tomb,
             Soft hairs blow; and beneath her armpits bloom
             The drowsy passion flowers of the dead.




                    A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY


The days had been very warm and quick. It was Fall now and everything
was drawing to a close. It had been a bad, but somehow pleasant, year. A
great number of people had been disillusioned and were not seen hurrying
from one place to another, as is customary with those of undisturbed
habit. They went slowly, and it was said that Winter with its snow and
frost would be most welcome.

Carmen la Tosca was in the habit of riding at a swift gallop down the
lane and into the copse beyond. She leaned ever so little in her saddle
as she went under the boughs. The plume of her hat bent and swung
smartly back into place as she rounded the curve.

Her horse was a clear cascade of white. The shining forelock, the soft
descending plane of the frontal bone melted into a taut nostril. And
where Carmen la Tosca broke the living line of its back with her own,
the spine flowed beneath her as deftly as water, and quivered into
massive alert haunches, which in turn socketed in velvet, a foaming
length of tail.

Carmen la Tosca rode well. She let more than usual of her pelvis drop
into the saddle. Upon the reins she kept gloved hands in a grip that was
consciously lacking in direction.

Carmen la Tosca was an actress. She had played in “Fife and Fiddle” and
“Drums of the King.”

She took parts suggesting a love of danger and intrigue. She was always
handsomely gloved and shod, and her dresses were widely copied.

She had been in stock, and in the beginning had sung in opera; she had
been the Queen in “Aïda” and she had played a boy’s part in vaudeville.
Now she was resting.

She was not the kind of woman who usually came to this quiet country
town, snuggled, as they say, among the foothills. The boy who kept the
general store said she was “stunning.” Little children ran backward
ahead of her, crying provokingly, “Red lips, red lips!” But no one
really knew her.

She had appeared in the Spring of the year with a man-servant and a
maid. For two days she had been seen at the windows hanging curtains.
When they were all hung no one saw her for some time. Then she bought a
white horse and rode it. And after that she always rode on the white
horse, though she had six or seven others before the Fall came. Usually
she rode alone. Now and again a gentleman, with a birth-mark twisting
his face into an unwilling irony, rode beside her. There was a goat path
in the underbrush and here two boys sometimes came and lay and talked of
her and waited for her to pass, riding that smart way on the white mare.
These boys were Brandt and Bailey Wilson, a farmer’s sons. Sometimes
couples, going berrying by the mountain road, came near enough to hear
her laughing behind the casement.

Sometimes she walked, descending the hill carefully, avoiding the melon
plants, talking brightly to a young man, but paying little attention to
the effect of her words, not through vanity, but simply through lack of
interest in the effect itself.

There was a great deal of gossip about her of course. She did not court
mystery, but it was all about her.

People said that she was not exactly beautiful, neither was she ugly.
Her face held the elements of both in perfect control. She was brutally
chic.

A lean, tall woman of the village, who had come from London, said Carmen
la Tosca’s back was like the Queen’s. This was probably an exaggeration.

Carmen la Tosca breakfasted in bed and late. She dusted her arms with
talc and she languidly settled into a light lace peignoir. She had tea
and rolls, and the bed stood between two unvarnished cherry-wood ovals,
in which were imprisoned two engravings of officials of the Tower of
London, in its bloodiest hour.

The double windows faced the orchard. She turned her back to the orchard
and its falling apples, and read St. Francis, or the morning paper which
was, by the time she received it, a day or two old.

The room was bare and grey and rustic. And in this Carmen la Tosca and
her bed made a strange contrast. She liked to think of it unless she had
other things on her mind. If the morning was chilly she had a quilted
jacket, and if it was raining she had the shades raised that she might
watch the rain falling a long way.

Early in the morning the boy chose it had been raining, but about eleven
it had stopped and the sun was trying to come out. Carmen la Tosca could
smell how wet everything was.

The boy was Brandt Wilson, fourteen; he had done rather well at the high
school of the nearest large town. He was short and his head was large
and his face already a little prematurely softened by melancholy. He was
splashed with mud and his red tie stuck out ridiculously at the top of a
vest that was too large for his small, shyly muscular chest.

He stood before her on the rug, his hat in his hand.

Carmen la Tosca, with a single movement, rolled over in bed.

“Who are you? Where did you come from?”

“I am Brandt Wilson. I came through the window. It was very easy.”

“Well,” she said. “What is it?”

The child hesitated, and with a look of distress, managed to say:

“I have a brother.”

Carmen la Tosca pushed away the paper and regarded him with amusement,
and a little amazement.

“He is two years older than I am—and there’s something I don’t
understand—and you know everything.”

“Who said so?”

“The neighbours, my father, my mother, my sister, the schoolmaster, the
postman——”

“That will do.”

“You are a woman of the world.” The childish sound of his voice became
terribly apparent.

“My brother is where no one understands—My sister said, ‘I don’t like
Bailey any more, he has lost that cunning little light in his eyes’—and
I said, ‘It’s still there when you give him something he likes, and he
is untying it, with his head bent down——’”

“How do you come to think of all this?”

“Once the sun was shining and we had been lying out on the bank with our
arms under our heads and then he said—he confessed”—the child faltered,
then looking at her directly and fixedly, said, “Bailey cried when he
knew it was over——”

“What was over?”

“I asked him, and he answered, ‘I am a man now.’ Shall I cry, too, when
I know that? What is it all about?”

Carmen la Tosca rose on her elbow and looked at him with suffused eyes
as if she had been crying, but it was all an illusion.

“How many of you are there?”

“Three. A married brother.”

“And how old is he?”

“Twenty-four. He cried once, too, but differently, about his sweetheart.
She died, you know, and when they told him he said, crying out, ‘I could
have saved her.’ We asked him how, but he would not tell us, but he told
mother; he said, ‘I would have said I love you.’ Is there such a power?”

Carmen la Tosca lay on her back, her hands beside her.

“That was innocence. We are all waiting for the day when people shall
learn of our innocence, all over again,” she said brightly.

“And is that suffering?”

“Yes, a special kind, for everyone,” she said gravely. “But not a
personal torment. You are not to believe in that. Suffering is all
alike, yours, mine, everybody’s. All these distinctions and what people
say about them is nonsense. Suffering is all the same everywhere for
everyone.” She suddenly rose up in bed and said, softly, “Now you do not
want to talk to me any more?”

He moved his fingers on the foot-board of the bed.

“I’m sorry,” she said hastily, covered with confusion. “It’s my
indolence that does it.”

“What?” he asked timidly.

“Embarrasses you.”

“It’s all right.”

“Now see here,” she continued. “Do you ever think of animals?”

“Why?”

“Do you?”

“I don’t know. I notice them——”

“Capital!” she cried, clapping her hands; “that’s what I wanted to know.
Well then, what would all this, you and I and your great trouble, mean
to them?”

“I don’t know what you mean.”

“Your questions, my answers? Nothing.”

He coloured, and looked down. “What does it mean?” he repeated, and as
he said it he could not remember what he had come for, or what he had
said, and while she was answering he tried desperately to re-establish
himself.

He said, “And you do not know what I must go through before I feel like
Bailey?”

“A little evil day by day, that makes everything grow.”

“Yes, that is what I wanted to know,” he said, breathlessly.

“Listen then, it’s all that makes the difference between a gentleman and
a fool. Never do evil to good people, they always forgive it, and that
is nasty.”

“But what about all these things that people talk of and I do not
understand?”

“The simple story, simply told by simple people—that in the end is all
you will listen to.”

“And I’m not to try to make anything out of all this?”

“No,” she said, “nothing at all, leave it alone.”

“And not to try to understand what made him cry?”

“Just as it is. The calf is born, she lies in the sun; she waits for the
end. That is dignity.”

“But sometimes I’m unhappy.”

“In the end you will know you know nothing. That will be the death of
you.”

Brandt stood still, though she had taken up her paper.

“Just that?”

“Come here,” she said, and he came, quickly. She put her hand out with a
gentle laugh and touched him. “There, that’s all.”

He went away then.




                            FIRST COMMUNION


                 The mortal fruit upon the bough
                 Hangs above the nuptial bed.
                 The cat-bird in the tree returns
                 The forfeit of his mutual vow.

                 The hard, untimely apple of
                 The branch that feeds on watered rain
                 Takes the place upon her lips
                 Of her late lamented love.

                 Many hands together press
                 Shaped within a static prayer
                 Recall to one the chorister
                 Docile in his sexless dress.

                 The temperate winds reclaim the iced
                 Remorseless vapours of the snow.
                 The only pattern in the mind
                 Is the cross behind the Christ.




                                 FINIS


            For you, for me? Why then the striking hour,
            The wind among the curtains, and the tread
            Of some late gardener pulling at the flower
            They’ll lay between our hearts when we are dead.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

THE SISTERS


There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night
after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied
the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it
lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought,
I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew
that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said
to me: “I am not long for this world,” and I had thought his words
idle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the
window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always
sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and
the word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the
name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and
yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.

Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to
supper. While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if
returning to some former remark of his:

“No, I wouldn’t say he was exactly ... but there was something queer
... there was something uncanny about him. I’ll tell you my
opinion....”

He began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in his
mind. Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he used to be rather
interesting, talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him
and his endless stories about the distillery.

“I have my own theory about it,” he said. “I think it was one of those
... peculiar cases.... But it’s hard to say....”

He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory. My
uncle saw me staring and said to me:

“Well, so your old friend is gone, you’ll be sorry to hear.”

“Who?” said I.

“Father Flynn.”

“Is he dead?”

“Mr Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the house.”

I knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the
news had not interested me. My uncle explained to old Cotter.

“The youngster and he were great friends. The old chap taught him a
great deal, mind you; and they say he had a great wish for him.”

“God have mercy on his soul,” said my aunt piously.

Old Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his little beady black
eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from
my plate. He returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the
grate.

“I wouldn’t like children of mine,” he said, “to have too much to say
to a man like that.”

“How do you mean, Mr Cotter?” asked my aunt.

“What I mean is,” said old Cotter, “it’s bad for children. My idea is:
let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and
not be.... Am I right, Jack?”

“That’s my principle, too,” said my uncle. “Let him learn to box his
corner. That’s what I’m always saying to that Rosicrucian there: take
exercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my life I had a
cold bath, winter and summer. And that’s what stands to me now.
Education is all very fine and large.... Mr Cotter might take a pick of
that leg mutton,” he added to my aunt.

“No, no, not for me,” said old Cotter.

My aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table.

“But why do you think it’s not good for children, Mr Cotter?” she
asked.

“It’s bad for children,” said old Cotter, “because their minds are so
impressionable. When children see things like that, you know, it has an
effect....”

I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my
anger. Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!

It was late when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old Cotter for
alluding to me as a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from
his unfinished sentences. In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw
again the heavy grey face of the paralytic. I drew the blankets over my
head and tried to think of Christmas. But the grey face still followed
me. It murmured; and I understood that it desired to confess something.
I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and
there again I found it waiting for me. It began to confess to me in a
murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the
lips were so moist with spittle. But then I remembered that it had died
of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve
the simoniac of his sin.

The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little
house in Great Britain Street. It was an unassuming shop, registered
under the vague name of _Drapery_. The drapery consisted mainly of
children’s bootees and umbrellas; and on ordinary days a notice used to
hang in the window, saying: _Umbrellas Re-covered_. No notice was
visible now for the shutters were up. A crape bouquet was tied to the
door-knocker with ribbon. Two poor women and a telegram boy were
reading the card pinned on the crape. I also approached and read:

     July 1st, 1895
     The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine’s
     Church, Meath Street), aged sixty-five years.
     _R. I. P._

The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was
disturbed to find myself at check. Had he not been dead I would have
gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in
his arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered in his great-coat. Perhaps
my aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this
present would have roused him from his stupefied doze. It was always I
who emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled
too much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about
the floor. Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose
little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of
his coat. It may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave
his ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red
handkerchief, blackened, as it always was, with the snuff-stains of a
week, with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite
inefficacious.

I wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock. I
walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all the
theatrical advertisements in the shop-windows as I went. I found it
strange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt
even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I
had been freed from something by his death. I wondered at this for, as
my uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal. He
had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to
pronounce Latin properly. He had told me stories about the catacombs
and about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of
the different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments
worn by the priest. Sometimes he had amused himself by putting
difficult questions to me, asking me what one should do in certain
circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or
only imperfections. His questions showed me how complex and mysterious
were certain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as
the simplest acts. The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and
towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I
wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake
them; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the
Church had written books as thick as the _Post Office Directory_ and as
closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all
these intricate questions. Often when I thought of this I could make no
answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to
smile and nod his head twice or thrice. Sometimes he used to put me
through the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart;
and, as I pattered, he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now
and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately.
When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his
tongue lie upon his lower lip—a habit which had made me feel uneasy in
the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.

As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter’s words and tried
to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream. I remembered
that I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique
fashion. I felt that I had been very far away, in some land where the
customs were strange—in Persia, I thought.... But I could not remember
the end of the dream.

In the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning.
It was after sunset; but the window-panes of the houses that looked to
the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds. Nannie
received us in the hall; and, as it would have been unseemly to have
shouted at her, my aunt shook hands with her for all. The old woman
pointed upwards interrogatively and, on my aunt’s nodding, proceeded to
toil up the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being scarcely
above the level of the banister-rail. At the first landing she stopped
and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the
dead-room. My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated
to enter, began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand.

I went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the blind was
suffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like
pale thin flames. He had been coffined. Nannie gave the lead and we
three knelt down at the foot of the bed. I pretended to pray but I
could not gather my thoughts because the old woman’s mutterings
distracted me. I noticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back
and how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side.
The fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in
his coffin.

But no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he
was not smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the
altar, his large hands loosely retaining a chalice. His face was very
truculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled
by a scanty white fur. There was a heavy odour in the room—the flowers.

We blessed ourselves and came away. In the little room downstairs we
found Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state. I groped my way towards
my usual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and
brought out a decanter of sherry and some wine-glasses. She set these
on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at
her sister’s bidding, she filled out the sherry into the glasses and
passed them to us. She pressed me to take some cream crackers also but
I declined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them.
She seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over
quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister. No one spoke:
we all gazed at the empty fireplace.

My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:

“Ah, well, he’s gone to a better world.”

Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt fingered the
stem of her wine-glass before sipping a little.

“Did he ... peacefully?” she asked.

“Oh, quite peacefully, ma’am,” said Eliza. “You couldn’t tell when the
breath went out of him. He had a beautiful death, God be praised.”

“And everything...?”

“Father O’Rourke was in with him a Tuesday and anointed him and
prepared him and all.”

“He knew then?”

“He was quite resigned.”

“He looks quite resigned,” said my aunt.

“That’s what the woman we had in to wash him said. She said he just
looked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful and resigned. No
one would think he’d make such a beautiful corpse.”

“Yes, indeed,” said my aunt.

She sipped a little more from her glass and said:

“Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to
know that you did all you could for him. You were both very kind to
him, I must say.”

Eliza smoothed her dress over her knees.

“Ah, poor James!” she said. “God knows we done all we could, as poor as
we are—we wouldn’t see him want anything while he was in it.”

Nannie had leaned her head against the sofa-pillow and seemed about to
fall asleep.

“There’s poor Nannie,” said Eliza, looking at her, “she’s wore out. All
the work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to wash him and then
laying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the Mass in
the chapel. Only for Father O’Rourke I don’t know what we’d have done
at all. It was him brought us all them flowers and them two
candlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the
_Freeman’s General_ and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery
and poor James’s insurance.”

“Wasn’t that good of him?” said my aunt.

Eliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly.

“Ah, there’s no friends like the old friends,” she said, “when all is
said and done, no friends that a body can trust.”

“Indeed, that’s true,” said my aunt. “And I’m sure now that he’s gone
to his eternal reward he won’t forget you and all your kindness to
him.”

“Ah, poor James!” said Eliza. “He was no great trouble to us. You
wouldn’t hear him in the house any more than now. Still, I know he’s
gone and all to that....”

“It’s when it’s all over that you’ll miss him,” said my aunt.

“I know that,” said Eliza. “I won’t be bringing him in his cup of
beef-tea any more, nor you, ma’am, sending him his snuff. Ah, poor
James!”

She stopped, as if she were communing with the past and then said
shrewdly:

“Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him
latterly. Whenever I’d bring in his soup to him there I’d find him with
his breviary fallen to the floor, lying back in the chair and his mouth
open.”

She laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she continued:

“But still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over
he’d go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again
where we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with
him. If we could only get one of them new-fangled carriages that makes
no noise that Father O’Rourke told him about, them with the rheumatic
wheels, for the day cheap—he said, at Johnny Rush’s over the way there
and drive out the three of us together of a Sunday evening. He had his
mind set on that.... Poor James!”

“The Lord have mercy on his soul!” said my aunt.

Eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it. Then she
put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some
time without speaking.

“He was too scrupulous always,” she said. “The duties of the priesthood
was too much for him. And then his life was, you might say, crossed.”

“Yes,” said my aunt. “He was a disappointed man. You could see that.”

A silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I
approached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to
my chair in the corner. Eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery.
We waited respectfully for her to break the silence: and after a long
pause she said slowly:

“It was that chalice he broke.... That was the beginning of it. Of
course, they say it was all right, that it contained nothing, I mean.
But still.... They say it was the boy’s fault. But poor James was so
nervous, God be merciful to him!”

“And was that it?” said my aunt. “I heard something....”

Eliza nodded.

“That affected his mind,” she said. “After that he began to mope by
himself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself. So one night
he was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn’t find him anywhere.
They looked high up and low down; and still they couldn’t see a sight
of him anywhere. So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel. So then
they got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father
O’Rourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to
look for him.... And what do you think but there he was, sitting up by
himself in the dark in his confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like
softly to himself?”

She stopped suddenly as if to listen. I too listened; but there was no
sound in the house: and I knew that the old priest was lying still in
his coffin as we had seen him, solemn and truculent in death, an idle
chalice on his breast.

Eliza resumed:

“Wide-awake and laughing-like to himself.... So then, of course, when
they saw that, that made them think that there was something gone wrong
with him....”




AN ENCOUNTER


It was Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us. He had a little
library made up of old numbers of _The Union Jack_, _Pluck_ and _The
Halfpenny Marvel_. Every evening after school we met in his back garden
and arranged Indian battles. He and his fat young brother Leo, the
idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm;
or we fought a pitched battle on the grass. But, however well we
fought, we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe
Dillon’s war dance of victory. His parents went to eight-o’clock mass
every morning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs Dillon
was prevalent in the hall of the house. But he played too fiercely for
us who were younger and more timid. He looked like some kind of an
Indian when he capered round the garden, an old tea-cosy on his head,
beating a tin with his fist and yelling:

“Ya! yaka, yaka, yaka!”

Everyone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a vocation
for the priesthood. Nevertheless it was true.

A spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its
influence, differences of culture and constitution were waived. We
banded ourselves together, some boldly, some in jest and some almost in
fear: and of the number of these latter, the reluctant Indians who were
afraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness, I was one. The
adventures related in the literature of the Wild West were remote from
my nature but, at least, they opened doors of escape. I liked better
some American detective stories which were traversed from time to time
by unkempt fierce and beautiful girls. Though there was nothing wrong
in these stories and though their intention was sometimes literary they
were circulated secretly at school. One day when Father Butler was
hearing the four pages of Roman History clumsy Leo Dillon was
discovered with a copy of _The Halfpenny Marvel_.

“This page or this page? This page? Now, Dillon, up! _‘Hardly had the
day’...._ Go on! What day? _‘Hardly had the day dawned’...._ Have you
studied it? What have you there in your pocket?”

Everyone’s heart palpitated as Leo Dillon handed up the paper and
everyone assumed an innocent face. Father Butler turned over the pages,
frowning.

“What is this rubbish?” he said. “_The Apache Chief!_ Is this what you
read instead of studying your Roman History? Let me not find any more
of this wretched stuff in this college. The man who wrote it, I
suppose, was some wretched fellow who writes these things for a drink.
I’m surprised at boys like you, educated, reading such stuff. I could
understand it if you were ... National School boys. Now, Dillon, I
advise you strongly, get at your work or....”

This rebuke during the sober hours of school paled much of the glory of
the Wild West for me and the confused puffy face of Leo Dillon awakened
one of my consciences. But when the restraining influence of the school
was at a distance I began to hunger again for wild sensations, for the
escape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me. The
mimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the
routine of school in the morning because I wanted real adventures to
happen to myself. But real adventures, I reflected, do not happen to
people who remain at home: they must be sought abroad.

The summer holidays were near at hand when I made up my mind to break
out of the weariness of school-life for one day at least. With Leo
Dillon and a boy named Mahony I planned a day’s miching. Each of us
saved up sixpence. We were to meet at ten in the morning on the Canal
Bridge. Mahony’s big sister was to write an excuse for him and Leo
Dillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick. We arranged to go
along the Wharf Road until we came to the ships, then to cross in the
ferryboat and walk out to see the Pigeon House. Leo Dillon was afraid
we might meet Father Butler or someone out of the college; but Mahony
asked, very sensibly, what would Father Butler be doing out at the
Pigeon House. We were reassured: and I brought the first stage of the
plot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two, at the same
time showing them my own sixpence. When we were making the last
arrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited. We shook hands,
laughing, and Mahony said:

“Till tomorrow, mates!”

That night I slept badly. In the morning I was first-comer to the
bridge as I lived nearest. I hid my books in the long grass near the
ashpit at the end of the garden where nobody ever came and hurried
along the canal bank. It was a mild sunny morning in the first week of
June. I sat up on the coping of the bridge admiring my frail canvas
shoes which I had diligently pipeclayed overnight and watching the
docile horses pulling a tramload of business people up the hill. All
the branches of the tall trees which lined the mall were gay with
little light green leaves and the sunlight slanted through them on to
the water. The granite stone of the bridge was beginning to be warm and
I began to pat it with my hands in time to an air in my head. I was
very happy.

When I had been sitting there for five or ten minutes I saw Mahony’s
grey suit approaching. He came up the hill, smiling, and clambered up
beside me on the bridge. While we were waiting he brought out the
catapult which bulged from his inner pocket and explained some
improvements which he had made in it. I asked him why he had brought it
and he told me he had brought it to have some gas with the birds.
Mahony used slang freely, and spoke of Father Butler as Old Bunser. We
waited on for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of
Leo Dillon. Mahony, at last, jumped down and said:

“Come along. I knew Fatty’d funk it.”

“And his sixpence...?” I said.

“That’s forfeit,” said Mahony. “And so much the better for us—a bob and
a tanner instead of a bob.”

We walked along the North Strand Road till we came to the Vitriol Works
and then turned to the right along the Wharf Road. Mahony began to play
the Indian as soon as we were out of public sight. He chased a crowd of
ragged girls, brandishing his unloaded catapult and, when two ragged
boys began, out of chivalry, to fling stones at us, he proposed that we
should charge them. I objected that the boys were too small and so we
walked on, the ragged troop screaming after us: _“Swaddlers!
Swaddlers!”_ thinking that we were Protestants because Mahony, who was
dark-complexioned, wore the silver badge of a cricket club in his cap.
When we came to the Smoothing Iron we arranged a siege; but it was a
failure because you must have at least three. We revenged ourselves on
Leo Dillon by saying what a funk he was and guessing how many he would
get at three o’clock from Mr Ryan.

We came then near the river. We spent a long time walking about the
noisy streets flanked by high stone walls, watching the working of
cranes and engines and often being shouted at for our immobility by the
drivers of groaning carts. It was noon when we reached the quays and,
as all the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches, we bought two
big currant buns and sat down to eat them on some metal piping beside
the river. We pleased ourselves with the spectacle of Dublin’s
commerce—the barges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly
smoke, the brown fishing fleet beyond Ringsend, the big white
sailing-vessel which was being discharged on the opposite quay. Mahony
said it would be right skit to run away to sea on one of those big
ships and even I, looking at the high masts, saw, or imagined, the
geography which had been scantily dosed to me at school gradually
taking substance under my eyes. School and home seemed to recede from
us and their influences upon us seemed to wane.

We crossed the Liffey in the ferryboat, paying our toll to be
transported in the company of two labourers and a little Jew with a
bag. We were serious to the point of solemnity, but once during the
short voyage our eyes met and we laughed. When we landed we watched the
discharging of the graceful threemaster which we had observed from the
other quay. Some bystander said that she was a Norwegian vessel. I went
to the stern and tried to decipher the legend upon it but, failing to
do so, I came back and examined the foreign sailors to see had any of
them green eyes for I had some confused notion.... The sailors’ eyes
were blue and grey and even black. The only sailor whose eyes could
have been called green was a tall man who amused the crowd on the quay
by calling out cheerfully every time the planks fell:

“All right! All right!”

When we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into Ringsend. The
day had grown sultry, and in the windows of the grocers’ shops musty
biscuits lay bleaching. We bought some biscuits and chocolate which we
ate sedulously as we wandered through the squalid streets where the
families of the fishermen live. We could find no dairy and so we went
into a huckster’s shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each.
Refreshed by this, Mahony chased a cat down a lane, but the cat escaped
into a wide field. We both felt rather tired and when we reached the
field we made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we
could see the Dodder.

It was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of
visiting the Pigeon House. We had to be home before four o’clock lest
our adventure should be discovered. Mahony looked regretfully at his
catapult and I had to suggest going home by train before he regained
any cheerfulness. The sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our
jaded thoughts and the crumbs of our provisions.

There was nobody but ourselves in the field. When we had lain on the
bank for some time without speaking I saw a man approaching from the
far end of the field. I watched him lazily as I chewed one of those
green stems on which girls tell fortunes. He came along by the bank
slowly. He walked with one hand upon his hip and in the other hand he
held a stick with which he tapped the turf lightly. He was shabbily
dressed in a suit of greenish-black and wore what we used to call a
jerry hat with a high crown. He seemed to be fairly old for his
moustache was ashen-grey. When he passed at our feet he glanced up at
us quickly and then continued his way. We followed him with our eyes
and saw that when he had gone on for perhaps fifty paces he turned
about and began to retrace his steps. He walked towards us very slowly,
always tapping the ground with his stick, so slowly that I thought he
was looking for something in the grass.

He stopped when he came level with us and bade us good-day. We answered
him and he sat down beside us on the slope slowly and with great care.
He began to talk of the weather, saying that it would be a very hot
summer and adding that the seasons had changed greatly since he was a
boy—a long time ago. He said that the happiest time of one’s life was
undoubtedly one’s schoolboy days and that he would give anything to be
young again. While he expressed these sentiments which bored us a
little we kept silent. Then he began to talk of school and of books. He
asked us whether we had read the poetry of Thomas Moore or the works of
Sir Walter Scott and Lord Lytton. I pretended that I had read every
book he mentioned so that in the end he said:

“Ah, I can see you are a bookworm like myself. Now,” he added, pointing
to Mahony who was regarding us with open eyes, “he is different; he
goes in for games.”

He said he had all Sir Walter Scott’s works and all Lord Lytton’s works
at home and never tired of reading them. “Of course,” he said, “there
were some of Lord Lytton’s works which boys couldn’t read.” Mahony
asked why couldn’t boys read them—a question which agitated and pained
me because I was afraid the man would think I was as stupid as Mahony.
The man, however, only smiled. I saw that he had great gaps in his
mouth between his yellow teeth. Then he asked us which of us had the
most sweethearts. Mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties.
The man asked me how many had I. I answered that I had none. He did not
believe me and said he was sure I must have one. I was silent.

“Tell us,” said Mahony pertly to the man, “how many have you yourself?”

The man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he had lots
of sweethearts.

“Every boy,” he said, “has a little sweetheart.”

His attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man of
his age. In my heart I thought that what he said about boys and
sweethearts was reasonable. But I disliked the words in his mouth and I
wondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared something or
felt a sudden chill. As he proceeded I noticed that his accent was
good. He began to speak to us about girls, saying what nice soft hair
they had and how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so
good as they seemed to be if one only knew. There was nothing he liked,
he said, so much as looking at a nice young girl, at her nice white
hands and her beautiful soft hair. He gave me the impression that he
was repeating something which he had learned by heart or that,
magnetised by some words of his own speech, his mind was slowly
circling round and round in the same orbit. At times he spoke as if he
were simply alluding to some fact that everybody knew, and at times he
lowered his voice and spoke mysteriously as if he were telling us
something secret which he did not wish others to overhear. He repeated
his phrases over and over again, varying them and surrounding them with
his monotonous voice. I continued to gaze towards the foot of the
slope, listening to him.

After a long while his monologue paused. He stood up slowly, saying
that he had to leave us for a minute or so, a few minutes, and, without
changing the direction of my gaze, I saw him walking slowly away from
us towards the near end of the field. We remained silent when he had
gone. After a silence of a few minutes I heard Mahony exclaim:

“I say! Look what he’s doing!”

As I neither answered nor raised my eyes Mahony exclaimed again:

“I say.... He’s a queer old josser!”

“In case he asks us for our names,” I said, “let you be Murphy and I’ll
be Smith.”

We said nothing further to each other. I was still considering whether
I would go away or not when the man came back and sat down beside us
again. Hardly had he sat down when Mahony, catching sight of the cat
which had escaped him, sprang up and pursued her across the field. The
man and I watched the chase. The cat escaped once more and Mahony began
to throw stones at the wall she had escaladed. Desisting from this, he
began to wander about the far end of the field, aimlessly.

After an interval the man spoke to me. He said that my friend was a
very rough boy and asked did he get whipped often at school. I was
going to reply indignantly that we were not National School boys to be
whipped, as he called it; but I remained silent. He began to speak on
the subject of chastising boys. His mind, as if magnetised again by his
speech, seemed to circle slowly round and round its new centre. He said
that when boys were that kind they ought to be whipped and well
whipped. When a boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him
any good but a good sound whipping. A slap on the hand or a box on the
ear was no good: what he wanted was to get a nice warm whipping. I was
surprised at this sentiment and involuntarily glanced up at his face.
As I did so I met the gaze of a pair of bottle-green eyes peering at me
from under a twitching forehead. I turned my eyes away again.

The man continued his monologue. He seemed to have forgotten his recent
liberalism. He said that if ever he found a boy talking to girls or
having a girl for a sweetheart he would whip him and whip him; and that
would teach him not to be talking to girls. And if a boy had a girl for
a sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such a
whipping as no boy ever got in this world. He said that there was
nothing in this world he would like so well as that. He described to me
how he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate
mystery. He would love that, he said, better than anything in this
world; and his voice, as he led me monotonously through the mystery,
grew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that I should
understand him.

I waited till his monologue paused again. Then I stood up abruptly.
Lest I should betray my agitation I delayed a few moments pretending to
fix my shoe properly and then, saying that I was obliged to go, I bade
him good-day. I went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating
quickly with fear that he would seize me by the ankles. When I reached
the top of the slope I turned round and, without looking at him, called
loudly across the field:

“Murphy!”

My voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my
paltry stratagem. I had to call the name again before Mahony saw me and
hallooed in answer. How my heart beat as he came running across the
field to me! He ran as if to bring me aid. And I was penitent; for in
my heart I had always despised him a little.




ARABY


North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street except at the
hour when the Christian Brothers’ School set the boys free. An
uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from
its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street,
conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown
imperturbable faces.

The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back
drawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all
the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old
useless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the
pages of which were curled and damp: _The Abbot_, by Walter Scott, _The
Devout Communicant_ and _The Memoirs of Vidocq_. I liked the last best
because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house
contained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes under one of
which I found the late tenant’s rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very
charitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to
institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister.

When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten
our dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The
space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and
towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The
cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts
echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through
the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the
rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping
gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous
stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music
from the buckled harness. When we returned to the street light from the
kitchen windows had filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the
corner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if
Mangan’s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his
tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We
waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained,
we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan’s steps resignedly. She was
waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened
door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the
railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body and the
soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side.

Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her
door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I
could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I
ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown
figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our
ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened
morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few
casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish
blood.

Her image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On
Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry some
of the parcels. We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by
drunken men and bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the
shrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs’
cheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a _come-all-you_
about O’Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native
land. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I
imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes. Her
name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which
I myself did not understand. My eyes were often full of tears (I could
not tell why) and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself
out into my bosom. I thought little of the future. I did not know
whether I would ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I
could tell her of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp
and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires.

One evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the priest had
died. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house.
Through one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the
earth, the fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden beds.
Some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me. I was thankful
that I could see so little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil
themselves and, feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed
the palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: _“O
love! O love!”_ many times.

At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was
so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I
going to _Araby_. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a
splendid bazaar, she said; she would love to go.

“And why can’t you?” I asked.

While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist.
She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week
in her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their
caps and I was alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes,
bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door
caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there
and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side
of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible
as she stood at ease.

“It’s well for you,” she said.

“If I go,” I said, “I will bring you something.”

What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts
after that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening
days. I chafed against the work of school. At night in my bedroom and
by day in the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove
to read. The syllables of the word _Araby_ were called to me through
the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment
over me. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My
aunt was surprised and hoped it was not some Freemason affair. I
answered few questions in class. I watched my master’s face pass from
amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could
not call my wandering thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with
the serious work of life which, now that it stood between me and my
desire, seemed to me child’s play, ugly monotonous child’s play.

On Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the
bazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the
hat-brush, and answered me curtly:

“Yes, boy, I know.”

As he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at
the window. I left the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards
the school. The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me.

When I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was
early. I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking
began to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the staircase and
gained the upper part of the house. The high cold empty gloomy rooms
liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front
window I saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries
reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the
cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived. I may have
stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast
by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved
neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.

When I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire.
She was an old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker’s widow, who collected
used stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the
tea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did
not come. Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn’t wait
any longer, but it was after eight o’clock and she did not like to be
out late as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began to
walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said:

“I’m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.”

At nine o’clock I heard my uncle’s latchkey in the halldoor. I heard
him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had
received the weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these signs.
When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give me the money
to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten.

“The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,” he said.

I did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:

“Can’t you give him the money and let him go? You’ve kept him late
enough as it is.”

My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed
in the old saying: “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” He
asked me where I was going and, when I had told him a second time he
asked me did I know _The Arab’s Farewell to his Steed_. When I left the
kitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my
aunt.

I held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street
towards the station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and
glaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my
seat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train. After an
intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept
onward among ruinous houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland
Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the
porters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the
bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the
train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform. I passed out on to
the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes
to ten. In front of me was a large building which displayed the magical
name.

I could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar
would be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a
shilling to a weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girdled
at half its height by a gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and
the greater part of the hall was in darkness. I recognised a silence
like that which pervades a church after a service. I walked into the
centre of the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the
stalls which were still open. Before a curtain, over which the words
_Café Chantant_ were written in coloured lamps, two men were counting
money on a salver. I listened to the fall of the coins.

Remembering with difficulty why I had come I went over to one of the
stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the door
of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young
gentlemen. I remarked their English accents and listened vaguely to
their conversation.

“O, I never said such a thing!”

“O, but you did!”

“O, but I didn’t!”

“Didn’t she say that?”

“Yes. I heard her.”

“O, there’s a ... fib!”

Observing me the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy
anything. The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have
spoken to me out of a sense of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars
that stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to
the stall and murmured:

“No, thank you.”

The young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back
to the two young men. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or
twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder.

I lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make
my interest in her wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly
and walked down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to
fall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a voice call from one
end of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall
was now completely dark.

Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and
derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.




EVELINE


She sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue. Her head
was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the
odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.

Few people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way
home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and
afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One
time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every
evening with other people’s children. Then a man from Belfast bought
the field and built houses in it—not like their little brown houses but
bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used
to play together in that field—the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns,
little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest,
however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to
hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually
little Keogh used to keep _nix_ and call out when he saw her father
coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father
was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long
time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her
mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone
back to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like
the others, to leave her home.

Home! She looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar objects
which she had dusted once a week for so many years, wondering where on
earth all the dust came from. Perhaps she would never see again those
familiar objects from which she had never dreamed of being divided. And
yet during all those years she had never found out the name of the
priest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken
harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to Blessed
Margaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend of her father.
Whenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass
it with a casual word:

“He is in Melbourne now.”

She had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise? She
tried to weigh each side of the question. In her home anyway she had
shelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her life about
her. Of course she had to work hard, both in the house and at business.
What would they say of her in the Stores when they found out that she
had run away with a fellow? Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place
would be filled up by advertisement. Miss Gavan would be glad. She had
always had an edge on her, especially whenever there were people
listening.

“Miss Hill, don’t you see these ladies are waiting?”

“Look lively, Miss Hill, please.”

She would not cry many tears at leaving the Stores.

But in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not be like
that. Then she would be married—she, Eveline. People would treat her
with respect then. She would not be treated as her mother had been.
Even now, though she was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in
danger of her father’s violence. She knew it was that that had given
her the palpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone for
her like he used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she was a girl;
but latterly he had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to
her only for her dead mother’s sake. And now she had nobody to protect
her. Ernest was dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating
business, was nearly always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the
invariable squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her
unspeakably. She always gave her entire wages—seven shillings—and Harry
always sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any money from
her father. He said she used to squander the money, that she had no
head, that he wasn’t going to give her his hard-earned money to throw
about the streets, and much more, for he was usually fairly bad of a
Saturday night. In the end he would give her the money and ask her had
she any intention of buying Sunday’s dinner. Then she had to rush out
as quickly as she could and do her marketing, holding her black leather
purse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowds and
returning home late under her load of provisions. She had hard work to
keep the house together and to see that the two young children who had
been left to her charge went to school regularly and got their meals
regularly. It was hard work—a hard life—but now that she was about to
leave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life.

She was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was very kind,
manly, open-hearted. She was to go away with him by the night-boat to
be his wife and to live with him in Buenos Ayres where he had a home
waiting for her. How well she remembered the first time she had seen
him; he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to
visit. It seemed a few weeks ago. He was standing at the gate, his
peaked cap pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a
face of bronze. Then they had come to know each other. He used to meet
her outside the Stores every evening and see her home. He took her to
see _The Bohemian Girl_ and she felt elated as she sat in an
unaccustomed part of the theatre with him. He was awfully fond of music
and sang a little. People knew that they were courting and, when he
sang about the lass that loves a sailor, she always felt pleasantly
confused. He used to call her Poppens out of fun. First of all it had
been an excitement for her to have a fellow and then she had begun to
like him. He had tales of distant countries. He had started as a deck
boy at a pound a month on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada.
He told her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the
different services. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and
he told her stories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen on his
feet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old country
just for a holiday. Of course, her father had found out the affair and
had forbidden her to have anything to say to him.

“I know these sailor chaps,” he said.

One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her
lover secretly.

The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap
grew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest
had been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming
old lately, she noticed; he would miss her. Sometimes he could be very
nice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read
her out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day,
when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill
of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother’s bonnet to
make the children laugh.

Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window,
leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of
dusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ
playing. She knew the air. Strange that it should come that very night
to remind her of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the
home together as long as she could. She remembered the last night of
her mother’s illness; she was again in the close dark room at the other
side of the hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The
organ-player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She
remembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying:

“Damned Italians! coming over here!”

As she mused the pitiful vision of her mother’s life laid its spell on
the very quick of her being—that life of commonplace sacrifices closing
in final craziness. She trembled as she heard again her mother’s voice
saying constantly with foolish insistence:

“Derevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!”

She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape!
Frank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But
she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to
happiness. Frank would take her in his arms, fold her in his arms. He
would save her.


She stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall. He
held her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her, saying
something about the passage over and over again. The station was full
of soldiers with brown baggages. Through the wide doors of the sheds
she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the
quay wall, with illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her
cheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to God
to direct her, to show her what was her duty. The boat blew a long
mournful whistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow she would be on
the sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres. Their passage had
been booked. Could she still draw back after all he had done for her?
Her distress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in
silent fervent prayer.

A bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand:

“Come!”

All the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her
into them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron
railing.

“Come!”

No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy.
Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish!

“Eveline! Evvy!”

He rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He was
shouted at to go on but he still called to her. She set her white face
to him, passive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no sign of
love or farewell or recognition.




AFTER THE RACE


The cars came scudding in towards Dublin, running evenly like pellets
in the groove of the Naas Road. At the crest of the hill at Inchicore
sightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars careering homeward
and through this channel of poverty and inaction the Continent sped its
wealth and industry. Now and again the clumps of people raised the
cheer of the gratefully oppressed. Their sympathy, however, was for the
blue cars—the cars of their friends, the French.

The French, moreover, were virtual victors. Their team had finished
solidly; they had been placed second and third and the driver of the
winning German car was reported a Belgian. Each blue car, therefore,
received a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill
and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by
those in the car. In one of these trimly built cars was a party of four
young men whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level of
successful Gallicism: in fact, these four young men were almost
hilarious. They were Charles Ségouin, the owner of the car; André
Rivière, a young electrician of Canadian birth; a huge Hungarian named
Villona and a neatly groomed young man named Doyle. Ségouin was in good
humour because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance (he
was about to start a motor establishment in Paris) and Rivière was in
good humour because he was to be appointed manager of the
establishment; these two young men (who were cousins) were also in good
humour because of the success of the French cars. Villona was in good
humour because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon; and besides he
was an optimist by nature. The fourth member of the party, however, was
too excited to be genuinely happy.

He was about twenty-six years of age, with a soft, light brown
moustache and rather innocent-looking grey eyes. His father, who had
begun life as an advanced Nationalist, had modified his views early. He
had made his money as a butcher in Kingstown and by opening shops in
Dublin and in the suburbs he had made his money many times over. He had
also been fortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and
in the end he had become rich enough to be alluded to in the Dublin
newspapers as a merchant prince. He had sent his son to England to be
educated in a big Catholic college and had afterwards sent him to
Dublin University to study law. Jimmy did not study very earnestly and
took to bad courses for a while. He had money and he was popular; and
he divided his time curiously between musical and motoring circles.
Then he had been sent for a term to Cambridge to see a little life. His
father, remonstrative, but covertly proud of the excess, had paid his
bills and brought him home. It was at Cambridge that he had met
Ségouin. They were not much more than acquaintances as yet but Jimmy
found great pleasure in the society of one who had seen so much of the
world and was reputed to own some of the biggest hotels in France. Such
a person (as his father agreed) was well worth knowing, even if he had
not been the charming companion he was. Villona was entertaining also—a
brilliant pianist—but, unfortunately, very poor.

The car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth. The two
cousins sat on the front seat; Jimmy and his Hungarian friend sat
behind. Decidedly Villona was in excellent spirits; he kept up a deep
bass hum of melody for miles of the road. The Frenchmen flung their
laughter and light words over their shoulders and often Jimmy had to
strain forward to catch the quick phrase. This was not altogether
pleasant for him, as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the
meaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind.
Besides Villona’s humming would confuse anybody; the noise of the car,
too.

Rapid motion through space elates one; so does notoriety; so does the
possession of money. These were three good reasons for Jimmy’s
excitement. He had been seen by many of his friends that day in the
company of these Continentals. At the control Ségouin had presented him
to one of the French competitors and, in answer to his confused murmur
of compliment, the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of
shining white teeth. It was pleasant after that honour to return to the
profane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks. Then as
to money—he really had a great sum under his control. Ségouin, perhaps,
would not think it a great sum but Jimmy who, in spite of temporary
errors, was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts knew well with
what difficulty it had been got together. This knowledge had previously
kept his bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness and, if he
had been so conscious of the labour latent in money when there had been
question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence, how much more
so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his substance! It
was a serious thing for him.

Of course, the investment was a good one and Ségouin had managed to
give the impression that it was by a favour of friendship the mite of
Irish money was to be included in the capital of the concern. Jimmy had
a respect for his father’s shrewdness in business matters and in this
case it had been his father who had first suggested the investment;
money to be made in the motor business, pots of money. Moreover Ségouin
had the unmistakable air of wealth. Jimmy set out to translate into
days’ work that lordly car in which he sat. How smoothly it ran. In
what style they had come careering along the country roads! The journey
laid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life and gallantly the
machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the
swift blue animal.

They drove down Dame Street. The street was busy with unusual traffic,
loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient
tram-drivers. Near the Bank Ségouin drew up and Jimmy and his friend
alighted. A little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay
homage to the snorting motor. The party was to dine together that
evening in Ségouin’s hotel and, meanwhile, Jimmy and his friend, who
was staying with him, were to go home to dress. The car steered out
slowly for Grafton Street while the two young men pushed their way
through the knot of gazers. They walked northward with a curious
feeling of disappointment in the exercise, while the city hung its pale
globes of light above them in a haze of summer evening.

In Jimmy’s house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion. A certain
pride mingled with his parents’ trepidation, a certain eagerness, also,
to play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at
least this virtue. Jimmy, too, looked very well when he was dressed
and, as he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his
dress tie, his father may have felt even commercially satisfied at
having secured for his son qualities often unpurchaseable. His father,
therefore, was unusually friendly with Villona and his manner expressed
a real respect for foreign accomplishments; but this subtlety of his
host was probably lost upon the Hungarian, who was beginning to have a
sharp desire for his dinner.

The dinner was excellent, exquisite. Ségouin, Jimmy decided, had a very
refined taste. The party was increased by a young Englishman named
Routh whom Jimmy had seen with Ségouin at Cambridge. The young men
supped in a snug room lit by electric candle-lamps. They talked volubly
and with little reserve. Jimmy, whose imagination was kindling,
conceived the lively youth of the Frenchmen twined elegantly upon the
firm framework of the Englishman’s manner. A graceful image of his, he
thought, and a just one. He admired the dexterity with which their host
directed the conversation. The five young men had various tastes and
their tongues had been loosened. Villona, with immense respect, began
to discover to the mildly surprised Englishman the beauties of the
English madrigal, deploring the loss of old instruments. Rivière, not
wholly ingenuously, undertook to explain to Jimmy the triumph of the
French mechanicians. The resonant voice of the Hungarian was about to
prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters when
Ségouin shepherded his party into politics. Here was congenial ground
for all. Jimmy, under generous influences, felt the buried zeal of his
father wake to life within him: he aroused the torpid Routh at last.
The room grew doubly hot and Ségouin’s task grew harder each moment:
there was even danger of personal spite. The alert host at an
opportunity lifted his glass to Humanity and, when the toast had been
drunk, he threw open a window significantly.

That night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men
strolled along Stephen’s Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. They
talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders.
The people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short
fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another
fat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the
party.

“André.”

“It’s Farley!”

A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very
well what the talk was about. Villona and Rivière were the noisiest,
but all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing
themselves together amid much laughter. They drove by the crowd,
blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells. They took the
train at Westland Row and in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they
were walking out of Kingstown Station. The ticket-collector saluted
Jimmy; he was an old man:

“Fine night, sir!”

It was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at
their feet. They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing _Cadet
Roussel_ in chorus, stamping their feet at every:

_“Ho! Ho! Hohé, vraiment!”_

They got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American’s
yacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona said with
conviction:

“It is delightful!”

There was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley
and Rivière, Farley acting as cavalier and Rivière as lady. Then an
impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures. What
merriment! Jimmy took his part with a will; this was seeing life, at
least. Then Farley got out of breath and cried _“Stop!”_ A man brought
in a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for form’s sake.
They drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank Ireland, England,
France, Hungary, the United States of America. Jimmy made a speech, a
long speech, Villona saying: _“Hear! hear!”_ whenever there was a
pause. There was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. It must
have been a good speech. Farley clapped him on the back and laughed
loudly. What jovial fellows! What good company they were!

Cards! cards! The table was cleared. Villona returned quietly to his
piano and played voluntaries for them. The other men played game after
game, flinging themselves boldly into the adventure. They drank the
health of the Queen of Hearts and of the Queen of Diamonds. Jimmy felt
obscurely the lack of an audience: the wit was flashing. Play ran very
high and paper began to pass. Jimmy did not know exactly who was
winning but he knew that he was losing. But it was his own fault for he
frequently mistook his cards and the other men had to calculate his
I.O.U.‘s for him. They were devils of fellows but he wished they would
stop: it was getting late. Someone gave the toast of the yacht _The
Belle of Newport_ and then someone proposed one great game for a
finish.

The piano had stopped; Villona must have gone up on deck. It was a
terrible game. They stopped just before the end of it to drink for
luck. Jimmy understood that the game lay between Routh and Ségouin.
What excitement! Jimmy was excited too; he would lose, of course. How
much had he written away? The men rose to their feet to play the last
tricks, talking and gesticulating. Routh won. The cabin shook with the
young men’s cheering and the cards were bundled together. They began
then to gather in what they had won. Farley and Jimmy were the heaviest
losers.

He knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he was glad
of the rest, glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his folly. He
leaned his elbows on the table and rested his head between his hands,
counting the beats of his temples. The cabin door opened and he saw the
Hungarian standing in a shaft of grey light:

“Daybreak, gentlemen!”




TWO GALLANTS


The grey warm evening of August had descended upon the city and a mild
warm air, a memory of summer, circulated in the streets. The streets,
shuttered for the repose of Sunday, swarmed with a gaily coloured
crowd. Like illumined pearls the lamps shone from the summits of their
tall poles upon the living texture below which, changing shape and hue
unceasingly, sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging
unceasing murmur.

Two young men came down the hill of Rutland Square. One of them was
just bringing a long monologue to a close. The other, who walked on the
verge of the path and was at times obliged to step on to the road,
owing to his companion’s rudeness, wore an amused listening face. He
was squat and ruddy. A yachting cap was shoved far back from his
forehead and the narrative to which he listened made constant waves of
expression break forth over his face from the corners of his nose and
eyes and mouth. Little jets of wheezing laughter followed one another
out of his convulsed body. His eyes, twinkling with cunning enjoyment,
glanced at every moment towards his companion’s face. Once or twice he
rearranged the light waterproof which he had slung over one shoulder in
toreador fashion. His breeches, his white rubber shoes and his jauntily
slung waterproof expressed youth. But his figure fell into rotundity at
the waist, his hair was scant and grey and his face, when the waves of
expression had passed over it, had a ravaged look.

When he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed
noiselessly for fully half a minute. Then he said:

“Well!... That takes the biscuit!”

His voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his words he added
with humour:

“That takes the solitary, unique, and, if I may so call it, _recherché_
biscuit!”

He became serious and silent when he had said this. His tongue was
tired for he had been talking all the afternoon in a public-house in
Dorset Street. Most people considered Lenehan a leech but, in spite of
this reputation, his adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his
friends from forming any general policy against him. He had a brave
manner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself
nimbly at the borders of the company until he was included in a round.
He was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories, limericks
and riddles. He was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy. No one
knew how he achieved the stern task of living, but his name was vaguely
associated with racing tissues.

“And where did you pick her up, Corley?” he asked.

Corley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip.

“One night, man,” he said, “I was going along Dame Street and I spotted
a fine tart under Waterhouse’s clock and said good-night, you know. So
we went for a walk round by the canal and she told me she was a slavey
in a house in Baggot Street. I put my arm round her and squeezed her a
bit that night. Then next Sunday, man, I met her by appointment. We
went out to Donnybrook and I brought her into a field there. She told
me she used to go with a dairyman.... It was fine, man. Cigarettes
every night she’d bring me and paying the tram out and back. And one
night she brought me two bloody fine cigars—O, the real cheese, you
know, that the old fellow used to smoke.... I was afraid, man, she’d
get in the family way. But she’s up to the dodge.”

“Maybe she thinks you’ll marry her,” said Lenehan.

“I told her I was out of a job,” said Corley. “I told her I was in
Pim’s. She doesn’t know my name. I was too hairy to tell her that. But
she thinks I’m a bit of class, you know.”

Lenehan laughed again, noiselessly.

“Of all the good ones ever I heard,” he said, “that emphatically takes
the biscuit.”

Corley’s stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly
body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the
roadway and back again. Corley was the son of an inspector of police
and he had inherited his father’s frame and gait. He walked with his
hands by his sides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from
side to side. His head was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all
weathers; and his large round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a
bulb which had grown out of another. He always stared straight before
him as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone
in the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips.
At present he was about town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was
always ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking
with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner
side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He
spoke without listening to the speech of his companions. His
conversation was mainly about himself: what he had said to such a
person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to
settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the
first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines.

Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on
through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the
passing girls but Lenehan’s gaze was fixed on the large faint moon
circled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the
grey web of twilight across its face. At length he said:

“Well ... tell me, Corley, I suppose you’ll be able to pull it off all
right, eh?”

Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer.

“Is she game for that?” asked Lenehan dubiously. “You can never know
women.”

“She’s all right,” said Corley. “I know the way to get around her, man.
She’s a bit gone on me.”

“You’re what I call a gay Lothario,” said Lenehan. “And the proper kind
of a Lothario, too!”

A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To save
himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the
interpretation of raillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind.

“There’s nothing to touch a good slavey,” he affirmed. “Take my tip for
it.”

“By one who has tried them all,” said Lenehan.

“First I used to go with girls, you know,” said Corley, unbosoming;
“girls off the South Circular. I used to take them out, man, on the
tram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the
theatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or something that way. I used
to spend money on them right enough,” he added, in a convincing tone,
as if he was conscious of being disbelieved.

But Lenehan could well believe it; he nodded gravely.

“I know that game,” he said, “and it’s a mug’s game.”

“And damn the thing I ever got out of it,” said Corley.

“Ditto here,” said Lenehan.

“Only off of one of them,” said Corley.

He moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it. The
recollection brightened his eyes. He too gazed at the pale disc of the
moon, now nearly veiled, and seemed to meditate.

“She was ... a bit of all right,” he said regretfully.

He was silent again. Then he added:

“She’s on the turf now. I saw her driving down Earl Street one night
with two fellows with her on a car.”

“I suppose that’s your doing,” said Lenehan.

“There was others at her before me,” said Corley philosophically.

This time Lenehan was inclined to disbelieve. He shook his head to and
fro and smiled.

“You know you can’t kid me, Corley,” he said.

“Honest to God!” said Corley. “Didn’t she tell me herself?”

Lenehan made a tragic gesture.

“Base betrayer!” he said.

As they passed along the railings of Trinity College, Lenehan skipped
out into the road and peered up at the clock.

“Twenty after,” he said.

“Time enough,” said Corley. “She’ll be there all right. I always let
her wait a bit.”

Lenehan laughed quietly.

“Ecod! Corley, you know how to take them,” he said.

“I’m up to all their little tricks,” Corley confessed.

“But tell me,” said Lenehan again, “are you sure you can bring it off
all right? You know it’s a ticklish job. They’re damn close on that
point. Eh?... What?”

His bright, small eyes searched his companion’s face for reassurance.
Corley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent
insect, and his brows gathered.

“I’ll pull it off,” he said. “Leave it to me, can’t you?”

Lenehan said no more. He did not wish to ruffle his friend’s temper, to
be sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted. A little
tact was necessary. But Corley’s brow was soon smooth again. His
thoughts were running another way.

“She’s a fine decent tart,” he said, with appreciation; “that’s what
she is.”

They walked along Nassau Street and then turned into Kildare Street.
Not far from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway,
playing to a little ring of listeners. He plucked at the wires
heedlessly, glancing quickly from time to time at the face of each
new-comer and from time to time, wearily also, at the sky. His harp,
too, heedless that her coverings had fallen about her knees, seemed
weary alike of the eyes of strangers and of her master’s hands. One
hand played in the bass the melody of _Silent, O Moyle_, while the
other hand careered in the treble after each group of notes. The notes
of the air sounded deep and full.

The two young men walked up the street without speaking, the mournful
music following them. When they reached Stephen’s Green they crossed
the road. Here the noise of trams, the lights and the crowd released
them from their silence.

“There she is!” said Corley.

At the corner of Hume Street a young woman was standing. She wore a
blue dress and a white sailor hat. She stood on the curbstone, swinging
a sunshade in one hand. Lenehan grew lively.

“Let’s have a look at her, Corley,” he said.

Corley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin appeared
on his face.

“Are you trying to get inside me?” he asked.

“Damn it!” said Lenehan boldly, “I don’t want an introduction. All I
want is to have a look at her. I’m not going to eat her.”

“O.... A look at her?” said Corley, more amiably. “Well ... I’ll tell
you what. I’ll go over and talk to her and you can pass by.”

“Right!” said Lenehan.

Corley had already thrown one leg over the chains when Lenehan called
out:

“And after? Where will we meet?”

“Half ten,” answered Corley, bringing over his other leg.

“Where?”

“Corner of Merrion Street. We’ll be coming back.”

“Work it all right now,” said Lenehan in farewell.

Corley did not answer. He sauntered across the road swaying his head
from side to side. His bulk, his easy pace, and the solid sound of his
boots had something of the conqueror in them. He approached the young
woman and, without saluting, began at once to converse with her. She
swung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her heels.
Once or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and
bent her head.

Lenehan observed them for a few minutes. Then he walked rapidly along
beside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely. As
he approached Hume Street corner he found the air heavily scented and
his eyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young woman’s appearance.
She had her Sunday finery on. Her blue serge skirt was held at the
waist by a belt of black leather. The great silver buckle of her belt
seemed to depress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of
her white blouse like a clip. She wore a short black jacket with
mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa. The ends of her tulle
collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers
was pinned in her bosom, stems upwards. Lenehan’s eyes noted
approvingly her stout short muscular body. Frank rude health glowed in
her face, on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes. Her
features were blunt. She had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which
lay open in a contented leer, and two projecting front teeth. As he
passed Lenehan took off his cap and, after about ten seconds, Corley
returned a salute to the air. This he did by raising his hand vaguely
and pensively changing the angle of position of his hat.

Lenehan walked as far as the Shelbourne Hotel where he halted and
waited. After waiting for a little time he saw them coming towards him
and, when they turned to the right, he followed them, stepping lightly
in his white shoes, down one side of Merrion Square. As he walked on
slowly, timing his pace to theirs, he watched Corley’s head which
turned at every moment towards the young woman’s face like a big ball
revolving on a pivot. He kept the pair in view until he had seen them
climbing the stairs of the Donnybrook tram; then he turned about and
went back the way he had come.

Now that he was alone his face looked older. His gaiety seemed to
forsake him and, as he came by the railings of the Duke’s Lawn, he
allowed his hand to run along them. The air which the harpist had
played began to control his movements. His softly padded feet played
the melody while his fingers swept a scale of variations idly along the
railings after each group of notes.

He walked listlessly round Stephen’s Green and then down Grafton
Street. Though his eyes took note of many elements of the crowd through
which he passed they did so morosely. He found trivial all that was
meant to charm him and did not answer the glances which invited him to
be bold. He knew that he would have to speak a great deal, to invent
and to amuse, and his brain and throat were too dry for such a task.
The problem of how he could pass the hours till he met Corley again
troubled him a little. He could think of no way of passing them but to
keep on walking. He turned to the left when he came to the corner of
Rutland Square and felt more at ease in the dark quiet street, the
sombre look of which suited his mood. He paused at last before the
window of a poor-looking shop over which the words _Refreshment Bar_
were printed in white letters. On the glass of the window were two
flying inscriptions: _Ginger Beer_ and _Ginger Ale_. A cut ham was
exposed on a great blue dish while near it on a plate lay a segment of
very light plum-pudding. He eyed this food earnestly for some time and
then, after glancing warily up and down the street, went into the shop
quickly.

He was hungry for, except some biscuits which he had asked two grudging
curates to bring him, he had eaten nothing since breakfast-time. He sat
down at an uncovered wooden table opposite two work-girls and a
mechanic. A slatternly girl waited on him.

“How much is a plate of peas?” he asked.

“Three halfpence, sir,” said the girl.

“Bring me a plate of peas,” he said, “and a bottle of ginger beer.”

He spoke roughly in order to belie his air of gentility for his entry
had been followed by a pause of talk. His face was heated. To appear
natural he pushed his cap back on his head and planted his elbows on
the table. The mechanic and the two work-girls examined him point by
point before resuming their conversation in a subdued voice. The girl
brought him a plate of grocer’s hot peas, seasoned with pepper and
vinegar, a fork and his ginger beer. He ate his food greedily and found
it so good that he made a note of the shop mentally. When he had eaten
all the peas he sipped his ginger beer and sat for some time thinking
of Corley’s adventure. In his imagination he beheld the pair of lovers
walking along some dark road; he heard Corley’s voice in deep energetic
gallantries and saw again the leer of the young woman’s mouth. This
vision made him feel keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit. He was
tired of knocking about, of pulling the devil by the tail, of shifts
and intrigues. He would be thirty-one in November. Would he never get a
good job? Would he never have a home of his own? He thought how
pleasant it would be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good dinner to
sit down to. He had walked the streets long enough with friends and
with girls. He knew what those friends were worth: he knew the girls
too. Experience had embittered his heart against the world. But all
hope had not left him. He felt better after having eaten than he had
felt before, less weary of his life, less vanquished in spirit. He
might yet be able to settle down in some snug corner and live happily
if he could only come across some good simple-minded girl with a little
of the ready.

He paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out of the
shop to begin his wandering again. He went into Capel Street and walked
along towards the City Hall. Then he turned into Dame Street. At the
corner of George’s Street he met two friends of his and stopped to
converse with them. He was glad that he could rest from all his
walking. His friends asked him had he seen Corley and what was the
latest. He replied that he had spent the day with Corley. His friends
talked very little. They looked vacantly after some figures in the
crowd and sometimes made a critical remark. One said that he had seen
Mac an hour before in Westmoreland Street. At this Lenehan said that he
had been with Mac the night before in Egan’s. The young man who had
seen Mac in Westmoreland Street asked was it true that Mac had won a
bit over a billiard match. Lenehan did not know: he said that Holohan
had stood them drinks in Egan’s.

He left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up George’s Street. He
turned to the left at the City Markets and walked on into Grafton
Street. The crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his way up
the street he heard many groups and couples bidding one another
good-night. He went as far as the clock of the College of Surgeons: it
was on the stroke of ten. He set off briskly along the northern side of
the Green hurrying for fear Corley should return too soon. When he
reached the corner of Merrion Street he took his stand in the shadow of
a lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved and
lit it. He leaned against the lamp-post and kept his gaze fixed on the
part from which he expected to see Corley and the young woman return.

His mind became active again. He wondered had Corley managed it
successfully. He wondered if he had asked her yet or if he would leave
it to the last. He suffered all the pangs and thrills of his friend’s
situation as well as those of his own. But the memory of Corley’s
slowly revolving head calmed him somewhat: he was sure Corley would
pull it off all right. All at once the idea struck him that perhaps
Corley had seen her home by another way and given him the slip. His
eyes searched the street: there was no sign of them. Yet it was surely
half-an-hour since he had seen the clock of the College of Surgeons.
Would Corley do a thing like that? He lit his last cigarette and began
to smoke it nervously. He strained his eyes as each tram stopped at the
far corner of the square. They must have gone home by another way. The
paper of his cigarette broke and he flung it into the road with a
curse.

Suddenly he saw them coming towards him. He started with delight and,
keeping close to his lamp-post, tried to read the result in their walk.
They were walking quickly, the young woman taking quick short steps,
while Corley kept beside her with his long stride. They did not seem to
be speaking. An intimation of the result pricked him like the point of
a sharp instrument. He knew Corley would fail; he knew it was no go.

They turned down Baggot Street and he followed them at once, taking the
other footpath. When they stopped he stopped too. They talked for a few
moments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of a
house. Corley remained standing at the edge of the path, a little
distance from the front steps. Some minutes passed. Then the hall-door
was opened slowly and cautiously. A woman came running down the front
steps and coughed. Corley turned and went towards her. His broad figure
hid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up
the steps. The door closed on her and Corley began to walk swiftly
towards Stephen’s Green.

Lenehan hurried on in the same direction. Some drops of light rain
fell. He took them as a warning and, glancing back towards the house
which the young woman had entered to see that he was not observed, he
ran eagerly across the road. Anxiety and his swift run made him pant.
He called out:

“Hallo, Corley!”

Corley turned his head to see who had called him, and then continued
walking as before. Lenehan ran after him, settling the waterproof on
his shoulders with one hand.

“Hallo, Corley!” he cried again.

He came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face. He could
see nothing there.

“Well?” he said. “Did it come off?”

They had reached the corner of Ely Place. Still without answering,
Corley swerved to the left and went up the side street. His features
were composed in stern calm. Lenehan kept up with his friend, breathing
uneasily. He was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his
voice.

“Can’t you tell us?” he said. “Did you try her?”

Corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him. Then with
a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and, smiling,
opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple. A small gold coin shone
in the palm.




THE BOARDING HOUSE


Mrs Mooney was a butcher’s daughter. She was a woman who was quite able
to keep things to herself: a determined woman. She had married her
father’s foreman and opened a butcher’s shop near Spring Gardens. But
as soon as his father-in-law was dead Mr Mooney began to go to the
devil. He drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. It was no
use making him take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few
days after. By fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by
buying bad meat he ruined his business. One night he went for his wife
with the cleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbour’s house.

After that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a
separation from him with care of the children. She would give him
neither money nor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist
himself as a sheriff’s man. He was a shabby stooped little drunkard
with a white face and a white moustache and white eyebrows, pencilled
above his little eyes, which were pink-veined and raw; and all day long
he sat in the bailiff’s room, waiting to be put on a job. Mrs Mooney,
who had taken what remained of her money out of the butcher business
and set up a boarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing
woman. Her house had a floating population made up of tourists from
Liverpool and the Isle of Man and, occasionally, _artistes_ from the
music-halls. Its resident population was made up of clerks from the
city. She governed her house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give
credit, when to be stern and when to let things pass. All the resident
young men spoke of her as _The Madam_.

Mrs Mooney’s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and
lodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They shared in common
tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with
one another. They discussed with one another the chances of favourites
and outsiders. Jack Mooney, the Madam’s son, who was clerk to a
commission agent in Fleet Street, had the reputation of being a hard
case. He was fond of using soldiers’ obscenities: usually he came home
in the small hours. When he met his friends he had always a good one to
tell them and he was always sure to be on to a good thing—that is to
say, a likely horse or a likely _artiste_. He was also handy with the
mits and sang comic songs. On Sunday nights there would often be a
reunion in Mrs Mooney’s front drawing-room. The music-hall _artistes_
would oblige; and Sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped
accompaniments. Polly Mooney, the Madam’s daughter, would also sing.
She sang:

     _I’m a ... naughty girl.
         You needn’t sham:
         You know I am._

Polly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft hair and a small
full mouth. Her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through
them, had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which
made her look like a little perverse madonna. Mrs Mooney had first sent
her daughter to be a typist in a corn-factor’s office but, as a
disreputable sheriff’s man used to come every other day to the office,
asking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter, she had taken her
daughter home again and set her to do housework. As Polly was very
lively the intention was to give her the run of the young men. Besides,
young men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away.
Polly, of course, flirted with the young men but Mrs Mooney, who was a
shrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away:
none of them meant business. Things went on so for a long time and Mrs
Mooney began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when she
noticed that something was going on between Polly and one of the young
men. She watched the pair and kept her own counsel.

Polly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother’s
persistent silence could not be misunderstood. There had been no open
complicity between mother and daughter, no open understanding but,
though people in the house began to talk of the affair, still Mrs
Mooney did not intervene. Polly began to grow a little strange in her
manner and the young man was evidently perturbed. At last, when she
judged it to be the right moment, Mrs Mooney intervened. She dealt with
moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in this case she had
made up her mind.

It was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but
with a fresh breeze blowing. All the windows of the boarding house were
open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath
the raised sashes. The belfry of George’s Church sent out constant
peals and worshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus
before the church, revealing their purpose by their self-contained
demeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands.
Breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the
breakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of
eggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind. Mrs Mooney sat in the
straw arm-chair and watched the servant Mary remove the breakfast
things. She made Mary collect the crusts and pieces of broken bread to
help to make Tuesday’s bread-pudding. When the table was cleared, the
broken bread collected, the sugar and butter safe under lock and key,
she began to reconstruct the interview which she had had the night
before with Polly. Things were as she had suspected: she had been frank
in her questions and Polly had been frank in her answers. Both had been
somewhat awkward, of course. She had been made awkward by her not
wishing to receive the news in too cavalier a fashion or to seem to
have connived and Polly had been made awkward not merely because
allusions of that kind always made her awkward but also because she did
not wish it to be thought that in her wise innocence she had divined
the intention behind her mother’s tolerance.

Mrs Mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the
mantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery that the
bells of George’s Church had stopped ringing. It was seventeen minutes
past eleven: she would have lots of time to have the matter out with Mr
Doran and then catch short twelve at Marlborough Street. She was sure
she would win. To begin with she had all the weight of social opinion
on her side: she was an outraged mother. She had allowed him to live
beneath her roof, assuming that he was a man of honour, and he had
simply abused her hospitality. He was thirty-four or thirty-five years
of age, so that youth could not be pleaded as his excuse; nor could
ignorance be his excuse since he was a man who had seen something of
the world. He had simply taken advantage of Polly’s youth and
inexperience: that was evident. The question was: What reparation would
he make?

There must be reparation made in such cases. It is all very well for
the man: he can go his ways as if nothing had happened, having had his
moment of pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt. Some mothers
would be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money; she had
known cases of it. But she would not do so. For her only one reparation
could make up for the loss of her daughter’s honour: marriage.

She counted all her cards again before sending Mary up to Mr Doran’s
room to say that she wished to speak with him. She felt sure she would
win. He was a serious young man, not rakish or loud-voiced like the
others. If it had been Mr Sheridan or Mr Meade or Bantam Lyons her task
would have been much harder. She did not think he would face publicity.
All the lodgers in the house knew something of the affair; details had
been invented by some. Besides, he had been employed for thirteen years
in a great Catholic wine-merchant’s office and publicity would mean for
him, perhaps, the loss of his job. Whereas if he agreed all might be
well. She knew he had a good screw for one thing and she suspected he
had a bit of stuff put by.

Nearly the half-hour! She stood up and surveyed herself in the
pier-glass. The decisive expression of her great florid face satisfied
her and she thought of some mothers she knew who could not get their
daughters off their hands.

Mr Doran was very anxious indeed this Sunday morning. He had made two
attempts to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that he had been
obliged to desist. Three days’ reddish beard fringed his jaws and every
two or three minutes a mist gathered on his glasses so that he had to
take them off and polish them with his pocket-handkerchief. The
recollection of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute
pain to him; the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the
affair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he was almost
thankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation. The harm was done.
What could he do now but marry her or run away? He could not brazen it
out. The affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would be
certain to hear of it. Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows
everyone else’s business. He felt his heart leap warmly in his throat
as he heard in his excited imagination old Mr Leonard calling out in
his rasping voice: “Send Mr Doran here, please.”

All his long years of service gone for nothing! All his industry and
diligence thrown away! As a young man he had sown his wild oats, of
course; he had boasted of his free-thinking and denied the existence of
God to his companions in public-houses. But that was all passed and
done with ... nearly. He still bought a copy of _Reynolds’s Newspaper_
every week but he attended to his religious duties and for nine-tenths
of the year lived a regular life. He had money enough to settle down
on; it was not that. But the family would look down on her. First of
all there was her disreputable father and then her mother’s boarding
house was beginning to get a certain fame. He had a notion that he was
being had. He could imagine his friends talking of the affair and
laughing. She _was_ a little vulgar; sometimes she said “I seen” and
“If I had’ve known.” But what would grammar matter if he really loved
her? He could not make up his mind whether to like her or despise her
for what she had done. Of course he had done it too. His instinct urged
him to remain free, not to marry. Once you are married you are done
for, it said.

While he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and
trousers she tapped lightly at his door and entered. She told him all,
that she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and that her
mother would speak with him that morning. She cried and threw her arms
round his neck, saying:

“O Bob! Bob! What am I to do? What am I to do at all?”

She would put an end to herself, she said.

He comforted her feebly, telling her not to cry, that it would be all
right, never fear. He felt against his shirt the agitation of her
bosom.

It was not altogether his fault that it had happened. He remembered
well, with the curious patient memory of the celibate, the first casual
caresses her dress, her breath, her fingers had given him. Then late
one night as he was undressing for bed she had tapped at his door,
timidly. She wanted to relight her candle at his for hers had been
blown out by a gust. It was her bath night. She wore a loose open
combing-jacket of printed flannel. Her white instep shone in the
opening of her furry slippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her
perfumed skin. From her hands and wrists too as she lit and steadied
her candle a faint perfume arose.

On nights when he came in very late it was she who warmed up his
dinner. He scarcely knew what he was eating, feeling her beside him
alone, at night, in the sleeping house. And her thoughtfulness! If the
night was anyway cold or wet or windy there was sure to be a little
tumbler of punch ready for him. Perhaps they could be happy
together....

They used to go upstairs together on tiptoe, each with a candle, and on
the third landing exchange reluctant good-nights. They used to kiss. He
remembered well her eyes, the touch of her hand and his delirium....

But delirium passes. He echoed her phrase, applying it to himself:
_“What am I to do?”_ The instinct of the celibate warned him to hold
back. But the sin was there; even his sense of honour told him that
reparation must be made for such a sin.

While he was sitting with her on the side of the bed Mary came to the
door and said that the missus wanted to see him in the parlour. He
stood up to put on his coat and waistcoat, more helpless than ever.
When he was dressed he went over to her to comfort her. It would be all
right, never fear. He left her crying on the bed and moaning softly:
_“O my God!”_

Going down the stairs his glasses became so dimmed with moisture that
he had to take them off and polish them. He longed to ascend through
the roof and fly away to another country where he would never hear
again of his trouble, and yet a force pushed him downstairs step by
step. The implacable faces of his employer and of the Madam stared upon
his discomfiture. On the last flight of stairs he passed Jack Mooney
who was coming up from the pantry nursing two bottles of _Bass_. They
saluted coldly; and the lover’s eyes rested for a second or two on a
thick bulldog face and a pair of thick short arms. When he reached the
foot of the staircase he glanced up and saw Jack regarding him from the
door of the return-room.

Suddenly he remembered the night when one of the music-hall _artistes_,
a little blond Londoner, had made a rather free allusion to Polly. The
reunion had been almost broken up on account of Jack’s violence.
Everyone tried to quiet him. The music-hall _artiste_, a little paler
than usual, kept smiling and saying that there was no harm meant: but
Jack kept shouting at him that if any fellow tried that sort of a game
on with _his_ sister he’d bloody well put his teeth down his throat, so
he would.


Polly sat for a little time on the side of the bed, crying. Then she
dried her eyes and went over to the looking-glass. She dipped the end
of the towel in the water-jug and refreshed her eyes with the cool
water. She looked at herself in profile and readjusted a hairpin above
her ear. Then she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot. She
regarded the pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in
her mind secret amiable memories. She rested the nape of her neck
against the cool iron bed-rail and fell into a revery. There was no
longer any perturbation visible on her face.

She waited on patiently, almost cheerfully, without alarm, her memories
gradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future. Her hopes
and visions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows
on which her gaze was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for
anything.

At last she heard her mother calling. She started to her feet and ran
to the banisters.

“Polly! Polly!”

“Yes, mamma?”

“Come down, dear. Mr Doran wants to speak to you.”

Then she remembered what she had been waiting for.




A LITTLE CLOUD


Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the North Wall and
wished him godspeed. Gallaher had got on. You could tell that at once
by his travelled air, his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few
fellows had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled by
such success. Gallaher’s heart was in the right place and he had
deserved to win. It was something to have a friend like that.

Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his
meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s invitation and of the great city
London where Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,
though he was but slightly under the average stature, he gave one the
idea of being a little man. His hands were white and small, his frame
was fragile, his voice was quiet and his manners were refined. He took
the greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and used
perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The half-moons of his nails
were perfect and when he smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of
childish white teeth.

As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought what changes those
eight years had brought. The friend whom he had known under a shabby
and necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the London
Press. He turned often from his tiresome writing to gaze out of the
office window. The glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots
and walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses
and decrepit old men who drowsed on the benches; it flickered upon all
the moving figures—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel
paths and on everyone who passed through the gardens. He watched the
scene and thought of life; and (as always happened when he thought of
life) he became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of him. He
felt how useless it was to struggle against fortune, this being the
burden of wisdom which the ages had bequeathed to him.

He remembered the books of poetry upon his shelves at home. He had
bought them in his bachelor days and many an evening, as he sat in the
little room off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down from the
bookshelf and read out something to his wife. But shyness had always
held him back; and so the books had remained on their shelves. At times
he repeated lines to himself and this consoled him.

When his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of
his fellow-clerks punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal arch
of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and walked swiftly down
Henrietta Street. The golden sunset was waning and the air had grown
sharp. A horde of grimy children populated the street. They stood or
ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps before the gaping doors or
squatted like mice upon the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no
thought. He picked his way deftly through all that minute vermin-like
life and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions in which the
old nobility of Dublin had roystered. No memory of the past touched
him, for his mind was full of a present joy.

He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the value of the name. He
knew that people went there after the theatre to eat oysters and drink
liqueurs; and he had heard that the waiters there spoke French and
German. Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn up before
the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted by cavaliers, alight and
enter quickly. They wore noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were
powdered and they caught up their dresses, when they touched earth,
like alarmed Atalantas. He had always passed without turning his head
to look. It was his habit to walk swiftly in the street even by day and
whenever he found himself in the city late at night he hurried on his
way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes, however, he courted the
causes of his fear. He chose the darkest and narrowest streets and, as
he walked boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his
footsteps troubled him, the wandering silent figures troubled him; and
at times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like a leaf.

He turned to the right towards Capel Street. Ignatius Gallaher on the
London Press! Who would have thought it possible eight years before?
Still, now that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could remember
many signs of future greatness in his friend. People used to say that
Ignatius Gallaher was wild. Of course, he did mix with a rakish set of
fellows at that time, drank freely and borrowed money on all sides. In
the end he had got mixed up in some shady affair, some money
transaction: at least, that was one version of his flight. But nobody
denied him talent. There was always a certain ... something in Ignatius
Gallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself. Even when he was out
at elbows and at his wits’ end for money he kept up a bold face. Little
Chandler remembered (and the remembrance brought a slight flush of
pride to his cheek) one of Ignatius Gallaher’s sayings when he was in a
tight corner:

“Half time now, boys,” he used to say light-heartedly. “Where’s my
considering cap?”

That was Ignatius Gallaher all out; and, damn it, you couldn’t but
admire him for it.

Little Chandler quickened his pace. For the first time in his life he
felt himself superior to the people he passed. For the first time his
soul revolted against the dull inelegance of Capel Street. There was no
doubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you had to go away. You could
do nothing in Dublin. As he crossed Grattan Bridge he looked down the
river towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses. They
seemed to him a band of tramps, huddled together along the riverbanks,
their old coats covered with dust and soot, stupefied by the panorama
of sunset and waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise,
shake themselves and begone. He wondered whether he could write a poem
to express his idea. Perhaps Gallaher might be able to get it into some
London paper for him. Could he write something original? He was not
sure what idea he wished to express but the thought that a poetic
moment had touched him took life within him like an infant hope. He
stepped onward bravely.

Every step brought him nearer to London, farther from his own sober
inartistic life. A light began to tremble on the horizon of his mind.
He was not so old—thirty-two. His temperament might be said to be just
at the point of maturity. There were so many different moods and
impressions that he wished to express in verse. He felt them within
him. He tried to weigh his soul to see if it was a poet’s soul.
Melancholy was the dominant note of his temperament, he thought, but it
was a melancholy tempered by recurrences of faith and resignation and
simple joy. If he could give expression to it in a book of poems
perhaps men would listen. He would never be popular: he saw that. He
could not sway the crowd but he might appeal to a little circle of
kindred minds. The English critics, perhaps, would recognise him as one
of the Celtic school by reason of the melancholy tone of his poems;
besides that, he would put in allusions. He began to invent sentences
and phrases from the notice which his book would get. _“Mr Chandler has
the gift of easy and graceful verse.” ... “A wistful sadness pervades
these poems.” ... “The Celtic note.”_ It was a pity his name was not
more Irish-looking. Perhaps it would be better to insert his mother’s
name before the surname: Thomas Malone Chandler, or better still: T.
Malone Chandler. He would speak to Gallaher about it.

He pursued his revery so ardently that he passed his street and had to
turn back. As he came near Corless’s his former agitation began to
overmaster him and he halted before the door in indecision. Finally he
opened the door and entered.

The light and noise of the bar held him at the doorways for a few
moments. He looked about him, but his sight was confused by the shining
of many red and green wine-glasses. The bar seemed to him to be full of
people and he felt that the people were observing him curiously. He
glanced quickly to right and left (frowning slightly to make his errand
appear serious), but when his sight cleared a little he saw that nobody
had turned to look at him: and there, sure enough, was Ignatius
Gallaher leaning with his back against the counter and his feet planted
far apart.

“Hallo, Tommy, old hero, here you are! What is it to be? What will you
have? I’m taking whisky: better stuff than we get across the water.
Soda? Lithia? No mineral? I’m the same. Spoils the flavour.... Here,
_garçon_, bring us two halves of malt whisky, like a good fellow....
Well, and how have you been pulling along since I saw you last? Dear
God, how old we’re getting! Do you see any signs of aging in me—eh,
what? A little grey and thin on the top—what?”

Ignatius Gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely
cropped head. His face was heavy, pale and clean-shaven. His eyes,
which were of bluish slate-colour, relieved his unhealthy pallor and
shone out plainly above the vivid orange tie he wore. Between these
rival features the lips appeared very long and shapeless and
colourless. He bent his head and felt with two sympathetic fingers the
thin hair at the crown. Little Chandler shook his head as a denial.
Ignatius Galaher put on his hat again.

“It pulls you down,” he said. “Press life. Always hurry and scurry,
looking for copy and sometimes not finding it: and then, always to have
something new in your stuff. Damn proofs and printers, I say, for a few
days. I’m deuced glad, I can tell you, to get back to the old country.
Does a fellow good, a bit of a holiday. I feel a ton better since I
landed again in dear dirty Dublin.... Here you are, Tommy. Water? Say
when.”

Little Chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted.

“You don’t know what’s good for you, my boy,” said Ignatius Gallaher.
“I drink mine neat.”

“I drink very little as a rule,” said Little Chandler modestly. “An odd
half-one or so when I meet any of the old crowd: that’s all.”

“Ah, well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, cheerfully, “here’s to us and to
old times and old acquaintance.”

They clinked glasses and drank the toast.

“I met some of the old gang today,” said Ignatius Gallaher. “O’Hara
seems to be in a bad way. What’s he doing?”

“Nothing,” said Little Chandler. “He’s gone to the dogs.”

“But Hogan has a good sit, hasn’t he?”

“Yes; he’s in the Land Commission.”

“I met him one night in London and he seemed to be very flush.... Poor
O’Hara! Boose, I suppose?”

“Other things, too,” said Little Chandler shortly.

Ignatius Gallaher laughed.

“Tommy,” he said, “I see you haven’t changed an atom. You’re the very
same serious person that used to lecture me on Sunday mornings when I
had a sore head and a fur on my tongue. You’d want to knock about a bit
in the world. Have you never been anywhere even for a trip?”

“I’ve been to the Isle of Man,” said Little Chandler.

Ignatius Gallaher laughed.

“The Isle of Man!” he said. “Go to London or Paris: Paris, for choice.
That’d do you good.”

“Have you seen Paris?”

“I should think I have! I’ve knocked about there a little.”

“And is it really so beautiful as they say?” asked Little Chandler.

He sipped a little of his drink while Ignatius Gallaher finished his
boldly.

“Beautiful?” said Ignatius Gallaher, pausing on the word and on the
flavour of his drink. “It’s not so beautiful, you know. Of course, it
is beautiful.... But it’s the life of Paris; that’s the thing. Ah,
there’s no city like Paris for gaiety, movement, excitement....”

Little Chandler finished his whisky and, after some trouble, succeeded
in catching the barman’s eye. He ordered the same again.

“I’ve been to the Moulin Rouge,” Ignatius Gallaher continued when the
barman had removed their glasses, “and I’ve been to all the Bohemian
cafés. Hot stuff! Not for a pious chap like you, Tommy.”

Little Chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two
glasses: then he touched his friend’s glass lightly and reciprocated
the former toast. He was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned.
Gallaher’s accent and way of expressing himself did not please him.
There was something vulgar in his friend which he had not observed
before. But perhaps it was only the result of living in London amid the
bustle and competition of the Press. The old personal charm was still
there under this new gaudy manner. And, after all, Gallaher had lived,
he had seen the world. Little Chandler looked at his friend enviously.

“Everything in Paris is gay,” said Ignatius Gallaher. “They believe in
enjoying life—and don’t you think they’re right? If you want to enjoy
yourself properly you must go to Paris. And, mind you, they’ve a great
feeling for the Irish there. When they heard I was from Ireland they
were ready to eat me, man.”

Little Chandler took four or five sips from his glass.

“Tell me,” he said, “is it true that Paris is so ... immoral as they
say?”

Ignatius Gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm.

“Every place is immoral,” he said. “Of course you do find spicy bits in
Paris. Go to one of the students’ balls, for instance. That’s lively,
if you like, when the _cocottes_ begin to let themselves loose. You
know what they are, I suppose?”

“I’ve heard of them,” said Little Chandler.

Ignatius Gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his head.

“Ah,” he said, “you may say what you like. There’s no woman like the
Parisienne—for style, for go.”

“Then it is an immoral city,” said Little Chandler, with timid
insistence—“I mean, compared with London or Dublin?”

“London!” said Ignatius Gallaher. “It’s six of one and half-a-dozen of
the other. You ask Hogan, my boy. I showed him a bit about London when
he was over there. He’d open your eye.... I say, Tommy, don’t make
punch of that whisky: liquor up.”

“No, really....”

“O, come on, another one won’t do you any harm. What is it? The same
again, I suppose?”

“Well ... all right.”

“_François_, the same again.... Will you smoke, Tommy?”

Ignatius Gallaher produced his cigar-case. The two friends lit their
cigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served.

“I’ll tell you my opinion,” said Ignatius Gallaher, emerging after some
time from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge, “it’s a rum
world. Talk of immorality! I’ve heard of cases—what am I saying?—I’ve
known them: cases of ... immorality....”

Ignatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then, in a calm
historian’s tone, he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures
of the corruption which was rife abroad. He summarised the vices of
many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin. Some
things he could not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others
he had had personal experience. He spared neither rank nor caste. He
revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and
described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society
and ended by telling, with details, a story about an English duchess—a
story which he knew to be true. Little Chandler was astonished.

“Ah, well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “here we are in old jog-along
Dublin where nothing is known of such things.”

“How dull you must find it,” said Little Chandler, “after all the other
places you’ve seen!”

“Well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “it’s a relaxation to come over here,
you know. And, after all, it’s the old country, as they say, isn’t it?
You can’t help having a certain feeling for it. That’s human nature....
But tell me something about yourself. Hogan told me you had ... tasted
the joys of connubial bliss. Two years ago, wasn’t it?”

Little Chandler blushed and smiled.

“Yes,” he said. “I was married last May twelve months.”

“I hope it’s not too late in the day to offer my best wishes,” said
Ignatius Gallaher. “I didn’t know your address or I’d have done so at
the time.”

He extended his hand, which Little Chandler took.

“Well, Tommy,” he said, “I wish you and yours every joy in life, old
chap, and tons of money, and may you never die till I shoot you. And
that’s the wish of a sincere friend, an old friend. You know that?”

“I know that,” said Little Chandler.

“Any youngsters?” said Ignatius Gallaher.

Little Chandler blushed again.

“We have one child,” he said.

“Son or daughter?”

“A little boy.”

Ignatius Gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back.

“Bravo,” he said, “I wouldn’t doubt you, Tommy.”

Little Chandler smiled, looked confusedly at his glass and bit his
lower lip with three childishly white front teeth.

“I hope you’ll spend an evening with us,” he said, “before you go back.
My wife will be delighted to meet you. We can have a little music
and——”

“Thanks awfully, old chap,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “I’m sorry we
didn’t meet earlier. But I must leave tomorrow night.”

“Tonight, perhaps...?”

“I’m awfully sorry, old man. You see I’m over here with another fellow,
clever young chap he is too, and we arranged to go to a little
card-party. Only for that....”

“O, in that case....”

“But who knows?” said Ignatius Gallaher considerately. “Next year I may
take a little skip over here now that I’ve broken the ice. It’s only a
pleasure deferred.”

“Very well,” said Little Chandler, “the next time you come we must have
an evening together. That’s agreed now, isn’t it?”

“Yes, that’s agreed,” said Ignatius Gallaher. “Next year if I come,
_parole d’honneur_.”

“And to clinch the bargain,” said Little Chandler, “we’ll just have one
more now.”

Ignatius Gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked at it.

“Is it to be the last?” he said. “Because you know, I have an a.p.”

“O, yes, positively,” said Little Chandler.

“Very well, then,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “let us have another one as
a _deoc an doruis_—that’s good vernacular for a small whisky, I
believe.”

Little Chandler ordered the drinks. The blush which had risen to his
face a few moments before was establishing itself. A trifle made him
blush at any time: and now he felt warm and excited. Three small
whiskies had gone to his head and Gallaher’s strong cig
“I shall be less like a woman. You called me like a woman; well, you
shall see.”

She came close to him, her two thin arms pressed close to her side.

“You will do something big and grand—Rugo—for me?”

He looked down at her, puzzled and quiet. The cruel mouth was half open,
showing the shining line of her teeth. He nodded, but this time he moved
away from her and stood staring out into the street.

She came up behind him, caught both of his hands, and, leaning forward,
kissed him on the back of his neck. He tried to turn, but she held his
two hands a moment longer and then broke out of the shop at a run.

Presently he set to work again, sitting cross-legged on his table.

He wondered what he was expected to do. He had often spoken to her of
returning to the country, with a hint in his voice that she would be
there beside him, too. Now it had come to this.

He pondered. A hero—what was a hero—what made the difference between a
hero and himself, anyway? He remembered tales the gypsies had told him
about their greatest men when he had been in the old land of his birth.
They told a story of a lad who fought and fought, and finding himself
unequal to the task of killing his rival, flung himself off a mountain.

What would be the use of that—he would die, and then he might as well
not have lived. He thought of all the great people he had read of, or
had heard of, or had known. There was Jean the blacksmith, who had lost
an eye saving his child from a horse. If he lost an eye Addie would not
like him.

Napoleon—there was a well-known man; he had done so many things, it
seemed, for which people framed him in white enamel and hung him upon
their bedroom walls; but chiefly he had been renowned for his killing.
Rugo thought about that awhile and came to the illuminating conclusion
that all heroes were men who killed or were killed.

Well, the last was impossible; if he was killed he might just as well
have starved in the country and not have laid eyes on Addie. Therefore,
he must kill—but what—but whom?

Of course, he might save something or somebody, but they would have to
be in danger first, and there might not be any danger for days and days,
and he was tired of waiting.

Presently he laid his work aside, lowered the shade, and, lying face
down on his bed, he tried to think it all out clearly.

Presently he got a vivid picture of killing in his mind. He sat up and
put his hands two or three times over his face. It was damp. He sat on
the edge of the bed and looked at the carpet. His mind wandered. He
thought of the ducks he had longed to stroke, of the gentle, feeding
cows, of the fresh, clean air—then he thought again of Addie and of what
he must do. He tried to picture himself killing someone. He put his two
hands together and looked at them—there, that was the way. Then he
smiled. His hands, set as they were, could not have choked anything
larger than a thrush. He widened them, but he separated them instantly
and rubbed them down his legs, breathing heavily. What a terrible
business a hero’s was! He thought of the throbbing that must stop
beneath such hands as his. He got up, shaking his shoulders from side to
side as if his back hurt him. He pulled up the shade.

The butcher’s windows opposite attracted his attention. Two gas lights
were burning there vividly. Rugo could see flanks of beef laid out in
pans, little ruddy pools collecting about them like insertion. Fowl hung
by the necks and several hams lured the passer-by as they swung softly
this way and that.

He opened his door hesitatingly and shutting it carefully stepped out
into the roadway.

He crossed over and leaned his head against the glass. He looked in very
close now, and he could see the film that shrouded the dead eyes of the
fowl and the hares. Slabs of liver laid out in heaps, flanked by cuts of
tripe, drew his attention.

A strange sensation had hold of him in the pit of his stomach. It seemed
to him that he was turning pale. He raised his hand to his beard and
tugged at it.

Two or three red hairs separated and came out. He held them up between
him and the light. Then he darted in the back door of the shop.

Presently he emerged carrying a box. With the furtive and hurried step
of a man who is being observed he crossed the street. He opened the door
of his own little shop and, locking it quickly, he put the box in the
corner and turned down the light.

It was very dark and he stumbled. A little reflection came from the meat
shop window and touched the rims of his cardboards, and his pattern book
full of the funny strutting gentlemen. His heart was beating horribly
against his side. He began to question himself and stopped. He could
never do it unless he made his mind a resolute thing. He clenched his
teeth, blinking his eyes as he did so. He began to shiver.

Presently he threw himself on the ground in the corner near the box, his
arms over his head, his face flat upon the dust and grime of the boards.
He must do it quickly—but he couldn’t do it.

His mind began to wander again. He thought of the road, red and yellow
with the dying leaves of Autumn, of the great swaying shadows and the
sunlight breaking in between in little jagged spots like flowers. He
remembered the mosquitoes, and he got to his knees and let his hands
hang down at his sides.

The Summer had always been so pretty; the rains left the fields so
bright and sudden when they came into view over the top of the hill. The
ploughing had been good, he had really enjoyed that after all, only then
he had not known just how much he did enjoy it. What a pity that he had
not known what a good thing it all was then.

Something moved beside him, breathing softly. He uttered a sharp cry and
the same thing moved back, hitting a board, and was again silent.

He bent forward, thrust his two hands out, closed them—tighter, tighter
and tighter. A faint cry, a little jerking to and fro—that was all.

He stood up and turned the light on. He looked at his hands. Then
backing away from the corner, never letting his eyes rest there, he
plunged his hands up to the elbows in a pail of water. He threw a cupful
of it inside his shirt at the neck. He opened the door. Addie was there.

She came in softly, gently, insinuatingly. She could see by his face
that something very horrible and necessary had been done. She saw by his
face how it had hurt, by his hands what it must have cost him.

She came close to him. “What have you done, Rugo?” she said.

“I—I have killed,” he said, almost in a whisper.

“What—where?” She moved toward the centre of the room and then looked
into the corner.

“That?” she began to laugh.

“Take it or leave it,” he said suddenly in a loud and penetrating voice.

She stooped and lifted it up—a small grey rabbit.

She laid it down again. She placed her arm about him.

“Come quickly,” she said. “Comb your hair.”

She pushed him into the street. She was afraid of him, for there was
something strange and hard in his mouth and he walked putting each foot
down very flat and steady.

“Where are you going? What are you going to do?” He did not seem to know
that she was there, clinging to him, her arm about his waist. He had
forgotten her. He looked up into the air, sniffing it and smiling.

“Come,” she said, “we are going to have your boots shined.”




                          THE FLOWERING CORPSE


             So still she lies in this closed place apart,
             Her feet grown fragile for the ghostly tryst;
             Her pulse no longer striking in her wrist,
             Nor does its echo wander through her heart.

             Over the body and the quiet head
             Like stately ferns above an austere tomb,
             Soft hairs blow; and beneath her armpits bloom
             The drowsy passion flowers of the dead.




                    A BOY ASKS A QUESTION OF A LADY


The days had been very warm and quick. It was Fall now and everything
was drawing to a close. It had been a bad, but somehow pleasant, year. A
great number of people had been disillusioned and were not seen hurrying
from one place to another, as is customary with those of undisturbed
habit. They went slowly, and it was said that Winter with its snow and
frost would be most welcome.

Carmen la Tosca was in the habit of riding at a swift gallop down the
lane and into the copse beyond. She leaned ever so little in her saddle
as she went under the boughs. The plume of her hat bent and swung
smartly back into place as she rounded the curve.

Her horse was a clear cascade of white. The shining forelock, the soft
descending plane of the frontal bone melted into a taut nostril. And
where Carmen la Tosca broke the living line of its back with her own,
the spine flowed beneath her as deftly as water, and quivered into
massive alert haunches, which in turn socketed in velvet, a foaming
length of tail.

Carmen la Tosca rode well. She let more than usual of her pelvis drop
into the saddle. Upon the reins she kept gloved hands in a grip that was
consciously lacking in direction.

Carmen la Tosca was an actress. She had played in “Fife and Fiddle” and
“Drums of the King.”

She took parts suggesting a love of danger and intrigue. She was always
handsomely gloved and shod, and her dresses were widely copied.

She had been in stock, and in the beginning had sung in opera; she had
been the Queen in “Aïda” and she had played a boy’s part in vaudeville.
Now she was resting.

She was not the kind of woman who usually came to this quiet country
town, snuggled, as they say, among the foothills. The boy who kept the
general store said she was “stunning.” Little children ran backward
ahead of her, crying provokingly, “Red lips, red lips!” But no one
really knew her.

She had appeared in the Spring of the year with a man-servant and a
maid. For two days she had been seen at the windows hanging curtains.
When they were all hung no one saw her for some time. Then she bought a
white horse and rode it. And after that she always rode on the white
horse, though she had six or seven others before the Fall came. Usually
she rode alone. Now and again a gentleman, with a birth-mark twisting
his face into an unwilling irony, rode beside her. There was a goat path
in the underbrush and here two boys sometimes came and lay and talked of
her and waited for her to pass, riding that smart way on the white mare.
These boys were Brandt and Bailey Wilson, a farmer’s sons. Sometimes
couples, going berrying by the mountain road, came near enough to hear
her laughing behind the casement.

Sometimes she walked, descending the hill carefully, avoiding the melon
plants, talking brightly to a young man, but paying little attention to
the effect of her words, not through vanity, but simply through lack of
interest in the effect itself.

There was a great deal of gossip about her of course. She did not court
mystery, but it was all about her.

People said that she was not exactly beautiful, neither was she ugly.
Her face held the elements of both in perfect control. She was brutally
chic.

A lean, tall woman of the village, who had come from London, said Carmen
la Tosca’s back was like the Queen’s. This was probably an exaggeration.

Carmen la Tosca breakfasted in bed and late. She dusted her arms with
talc and she languidly settled into a light lace peignoir. She had tea
and rolls, and the bed stood between two unvarnished cherry-wood ovals,
in which were imprisoned two engravings of officials of the Tower of
London, in its bloodiest hour.

The double windows faced the orchard. She turned her back to the orchard
and its falling apples, and read St. Francis, or the morning paper which
was, by the time she received it, a day or two old.

The room was bare and grey and rustic. And in this Carmen la Tosca and
her bed made a strange contrast. She liked to think of it unless she had
other things on her mind. If the morning was chilly she had a quilted
jacket, and if it was raining she had the shades raised that she might
watch the rain falling a long way.

Early in the morning the boy chose it had been raining, but about eleven
it had stopped and the sun was trying to come out. Carmen la Tosca could
smell how wet everything was.

The boy was Brandt Wilson, fourteen; he had done rather well at the high
school of the nearest large town. He was short and his head was large
and his face already a little prematurely softened by melancholy. He was
splashed with mud and his red tie stuck out ridiculously at the top of a
vest that was too large for his small, shyly muscular chest.

He stood before her on the rug, his hat in his hand.

Carmen la Tosca, with a single movement, rolled over in bed.

“Who are you? Where did you come from?”

“I am Brandt Wilson. I came through the window. It was very easy.”

“Well,” she said. “What is it?”

The child hesitated, and with a look of distress, managed to say:

“I have a brother.”

Carmen la Tosca pushed away the paper and regarded him with amusement,
and a little amazement.

“He is two years older than I am—and there’s something I don’t
understand—and you know everything.”

“Who said so?”

“The neighbours, my father, my mother, my sister, the schoolmaster, the
postman——”

“That will do.”

“You are a woman of the world.” The childish sound of his voice became
terribly apparent.

“My brother is where no one understands—My sister said, ‘I don’t like
Bailey any more, he has lost that cunning little light in his eyes’—and
I said, ‘It’s still there when you give him something he likes, and he
is untying it, with his head bent down——’”

“How do you come to think of all this?”

“Once the sun was shining and we had been lying out on the bank with our
arms under our heads and then he said—he confessed”—the child faltered,
then looking at her directly and fixedly, said, “Bailey cried when he
knew it was over——”

“What was over?”

“I asked him, and he answered, ‘I am a man now.’ Shall I cry, too, when
I know that? What is it all about?”

Carmen la Tosca rose on her elbow and looked at him with suffused eyes
as if she had been crying, but it was all an illusion.

“How many of you are there?”

“Three. A married brother.”

“And how old is he?”

“Twenty-four. He cried once, too, but differently, about his sweetheart.
She died, you know, and when they told him he said, crying out, ‘I could
have saved her.’ We asked him how, but he would not tell us, but he told
mother; he said, ‘I would have said I love you.’ Is there such a power?”

Carmen la Tosca lay on her back, her hands beside her.

“That was innocence. We are all waiting for the day when people shall
learn of our innocence, all over again,” she said brightly.

“And is that suffering?”

“Yes, a special kind, for everyone,” she said gravely. “But not a
personal torment. You are not to believe in that. Suffering is all
alike, yours, mine, everybody’s. All these distinctions and what people
say about them is nonsense. Suffering is all the same everywhere for
everyone.” She suddenly rose up in bed and said, softly, “Now you do not
want to talk to me any more?”

He moved his fingers on the foot-board of the bed.

“I’m sorry,” she said hastily, covered with confusion. “It’s my
indolence that does it.”

“What?” he asked timidly.

“Embarrasses you.”

“It’s all right.”

“Now see here,” she continued. “Do you ever think of animals?”

“Why?”

“Do you?”

“I don’t know. I notice them——”

“Capital!” she cried, clapping her hands; “that’s what I wanted to know.
Well then, what would all this, you and I and your great trouble, mean
to them?”

“I don’t know what you mean.”

“Your questions, my answers? Nothing.”

He coloured, and looked down. “What does it mean?” he repeated, and as
he said it he could not remember what he had come for, or what he had
said, and while she was answering he tried desperately to re-establish
himself.

He said, “And you do not know what I must go through before I feel like
Bailey?”

“A little evil day by day, that makes everything grow.”

“Yes, that is what I wanted to know,” he said, breathlessly.

“Listen then, it’s all that makes the difference between a gentleman and
a fool. Never do evil to good people, they always forgive it, and that
is nasty.”

“But what about all these things that people talk of and I do not
understand?”

“The simple story, simply told by simple people—that in the end is all
you will listen to.”

“And I’m not to try to make anything out of all this?”

“No,” she said, “nothing at all, leave it alone.”

“And not to try to understand what made him cry?”

“Just as it is. The calf is born, she lies in the sun; she waits for the
end. That is dignity.”

“But sometimes I’m unhappy.”

“In the end you will know you know nothing. That will be the death of
you.”

Brandt stood still, though she had taken up her paper.

“Just that?”

“Come here,” she said, and he came, quickly. She put her hand out with a
gentle laugh and touched him. “There, that’s all.”

He went away then.




                            FIRST COMMUNION


                 The mortal fruit upon the bough
                 Hangs above the nuptial bed.
                 The cat-bird in the tree returns
                 The forfeit of his mutual vow.

                 The hard, untimely apple of
                 The branch that feeds on watered rain
                 Takes the place upon her lips
                 Of her late lamented love.

                 Many hands together press
                 Shaped within a static prayer
                 Recall to one the chorister
                 Docile in his sexless dress.

                 The temperate winds reclaim the iced
                 Remorseless vapours of the snow.
                 The only pattern in the mind
                 Is the cross behind the Christ.




                                 FINIS


            For you, for me? Why then the striking hour,
            The wind among the curtains, and the tread
            Of some late gardener pulling at the flower
            They’ll lay between our hearts when we are dead.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

THE SISTERS


There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night
after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied
the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it
lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought,
I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew
that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said
to me: “I am not long for this world,” and I had thought his words
idle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the
window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always
sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and
the word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the
name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and
yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.

Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to
supper. While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if
returning to some former remark of his:

“No, I wouldn’t say he was exactly ... but there was something queer
... there was something uncanny about him. I’ll tell you my
opinion....”

He began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in his
mind. Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he used to be rather
interesting, talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him
and his endless stories about the distillery.

“I have my own theory about it,” he said. “I think it was one of those
... peculiar cases.... But it’s hard to say....”

He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory. My
uncle saw me staring and said to me:

“Well, so your old friend is gone, you’ll be sorry to hear.”

“Who?” said I.

“Father Flynn.”

“Is he dead?”

“Mr Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the house.”

I knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the
news had not interested me. My uncle explained to old Cotter.

“The youngster and he were great friends. The old chap taught him a
great deal, mind you; and they say he had a great wish for him.”

“God have mercy on his soul,” said my aunt piously.

Old Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his little beady black
eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from
my plate. He returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the
grate.

“I wouldn’t like children of mine,” he said, “to have too much to say
to a man like that.”

“How do you mean, Mr Cotter?” asked my aunt.

“What I mean is,” said old Cotter, “it’s bad for children. My idea is:
let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and
not be.... Am I right, Jack?”

“That’s my principle, too,” said my uncle. “Let him learn to box his
corner. That’s what I’m always saying to that Rosicrucian there: take
exercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my life I had a
cold bath, winter and summer. And that’s what stands to me now.
Education is all very fine and large.... Mr Cotter might take a pick of
that leg mutton,” he added to my aunt.

“No, no, not for me,” said old Cotter.

My aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table.

“But why do you think it’s not good for children, Mr Cotter?” she
asked.

“It’s bad for children,” said old Cotter, “because their minds are so
impressionable. When children see things like that, you know, it has an
effect....”

I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my
anger. Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!

It was late when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old Cotter for
alluding to me as a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from
his unfinished sentences. In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw
again the heavy grey face of the paralytic. I drew the blankets over my
head and tried to think of Christmas. But the grey face still followed
me. It murmured; and I understood that it desired to confess something.
I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and
there again I found it waiting for me. It began to confess to me in a
murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the
lips were so moist with spittle. But then I remembered that it had died
of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve
the simoniac of his sin.

The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little
house in Great Britain Street. It was an unassuming shop, registered
under the vague name of _Drapery_. The drapery consisted mainly of
children’s bootees and umbrellas; and on ordinary days a notice used to
hang in the window, saying: _Umbrellas Re-covered_. No notice was
visible now for the shutters were up. A crape bouquet was tied to the
door-knocker with ribbon. Two poor women and a telegram boy were
reading the card pinned on the crape. I also approached and read:

     July 1st, 1895
     The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine’s
     Church, Meath Street), aged sixty-five years.
     _R. I. P._

The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was
disturbed to find myself at check. Had he not been dead I would have
gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in
his arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered in his great-coat. Perhaps
my aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this
present would have roused him from his stupefied doze. It was always I
who emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled
too much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about
the floor. Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose
little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of
his coat. It may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave
his ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red
handkerchief, blackened, as it always was, with the snuff-stains of a
week, with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite
inefficacious.

I wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock. I
walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all the
theatrical advertisements in the shop-windows as I went. I found it
strange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt
even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I
had been freed from something by his death. I wondered at this for, as
my uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal. He
had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to
pronounce Latin properly. He had told me stories about the catacombs
and about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of
the different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments
worn by the priest. Sometimes he had amused himself by putting
difficult questions to me, asking me what one should do in certain
circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or
only imperfections. His questions showed me how complex and mysterious
were certain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as
the simplest acts. The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and
towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I
wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake
them; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the
Church had written books as thick as the _Post Office Directory_ and as
closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all
these intricate questions. Often when I thought of this I could make no
answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to
smile and nod his head twice or thrice. Sometimes he used to put me
through the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart;
and, as I pattered, he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now
and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately.
When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his
tongue lie upon his lower lip—a habit which had made me feel uneasy in
the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.

As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter’s words and tried
to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream. I remembered
that I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique
fashion. I felt that I had been very far away, in some land where the
customs were strange—in Persia, I thought.... But I could not remember
the end of the dream.

In the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning.
It was after sunset; but the window-panes of the houses that looked to
the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds. Nannie
received us in the hall; and, as it would have been unseemly to have
shouted at her, my aunt shook hands with her for all. The old woman
pointed upwards interrogatively and, on my aunt’s nodding, proceeded to
toil up the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being scarcely
above the level of the banister-rail. At the first landing she stopped
and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the
dead-room. My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated
to enter, began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand.

I went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the blind was
suffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like
pale thin flames. He had been coffined. Nannie gave the lead and we
three knelt down at the foot of the bed. I pretended to pray but I
could not gather my thoughts because the old woman’s mutterings
distracted me. I noticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back
and how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side.
The fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in
his coffin.

But no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he
was not smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the
altar, his large hands loosely retaining a chalice. His face was very
truculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled
by a scanty white fur. There was a heavy odour in the room—the flowers.

We blessed ourselves and came away. In the little room downstairs we
found Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state. I groped my way towards
my usual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and
brought out a decanter of sherry and some wine-glasses. She set these
on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at
her sister’s bidding, she filled out the sherry into the glasses and
passed them to us. She pressed me to take some cream crackers also but
I declined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them.
She seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over
quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister. No one spoke:
we all gazed at the empty fireplace.

My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:

“Ah, well, he’s gone to a better world.”

Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt fingered the
stem of her wine-glass before sipping a little.

“Did he ... peacefully?” she asked.

“Oh, quite peacefully, ma’am,” said Eliza. “You couldn’t tell when the
breath went out of him. He had a beautiful death, God be praised.”

“And everything...?”

“Father O’Rourke was in with him a Tuesday and anointed him and
prepared him and all.”

“He knew then?”

“He was quite resigned.”

“He looks quite resigned,” said my aunt.

“That’s what the woman we had in to wash him said. She said he just
looked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful and resigned. No
one would think he’d make such a beautiful corpse.”

“Yes, indeed,” said my aunt.

She sipped a little more from her glass and said:

“Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to
know that you did all you could for him. You were both very kind to
him, I must say.”

Eliza smoothed her dress over her knees.

“Ah, poor James!” she said. “God knows we done all we could, as poor as
we are—we wouldn’t see him want anything while he was in it.”

Nannie had leaned her head against the sofa-pillow and seemed about to
fall asleep.

“There’s poor Nannie,” said Eliza, looking at her, “she’s wore out. All
the work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to wash him and then
laying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the Mass in
the chapel. Only for Father O’Rourke I don’t know what we’d have done
at all. It was him brought us all them flowers and them two
candlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the
_Freeman’s General_ and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery
and poor James’s insurance.”

“Wasn’t that good of him?” said my aunt.

Eliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly.

“Ah, there’s no friends like the old friends,” she said, “when all is
said and done, no friends that a body can trust.”

“Indeed, that’s true,” said my aunt. “And I’m sure now that he’s gone
to his eternal reward he won’t forget you and all your kindness to
him.”

“Ah, poor James!” said Eliza. “He was no great trouble to us. You
wouldn’t hear him in the house any more than now. Still, I know he’s
gone and all to that....”

“It’s when it’s all over that you’ll miss him,” said my aunt.

“I know that,” said Eliza. “I won’t be bringing him in his cup of
beef-tea any more, nor you, ma’am, sending him his snuff. Ah, poor
James!”

She stopped, as if she were communing with the past and then said
shrewdly:

“Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him
latterly. Whenever I’d bring in his soup to him there I’d find him with
his breviary fallen to the floor, lying back in the chair and his mouth
open.”

She laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she continued:

“But still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over
he’d go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again
where we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with
him. If we could only get one of them new-fangled carriages that makes
no noise that Father O’Rourke told him about, them with the rheumatic
wheels, for the day cheap—he said, at Johnny Rush’s over the way there
and drive out the three of us together of a Sunday evening. He had his
mind set on that.... Poor James!”

“The Lord have mercy on his soul!” said my aunt.

Eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it. Then she
put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some
time without speaking.

“He was too scrupulous always,” she said. “The duties of the priesthood
was too much for him. And then his life was, you might say, crossed.”

“Yes,” said my aunt. “He was a disappointed man. You could see that.”

A silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I
approached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to
my chair in the corner. Eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery.
We waited respectfully for her to break the silence: and after a long
pause she said slowly:

“It was that chalice he broke.... That was the beginning of it. Of
course, they say it was all right, that it contained nothing, I mean.
But still.... They say it was the boy’s fault. But poor James was so
nervous, God be merciful to him!”

“And was that it?” said my aunt. “I heard something....”

Eliza nodded.

“That affected his mind,” she said. “After that he began to mope by
himself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself. So one night
he was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn’t find him anywhere.
They looked high up and low down; and still they couldn’t see a sight
of him anywhere. So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel. So then
they got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father
O’Rourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to
look for him.... And what do you think but there he was, sitting up by
himself in the dark in his confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like
softly to himself?”

She stopped suddenly as if to listen. I too listened; but there was no
sound in the house: and I knew that the old priest was lying still in
his coffin as we had seen him, solemn and truculent in death, an idle
chalice on his breast.

Eliza resumed:

“Wide-awake and laughing-like to himself.... So then, of course, when
they saw that, that made them think that there was something gone wrong
with him....”




AN ENCOUNTER


It was Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us. He had a little
library made up of old numbers of _The Union Jack_, _Pluck_ and _The
Halfpenny Marvel_. Every evening after school we met in his back garden
and arranged Indian battles. He and his fat young brother Leo, the
idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm;
or we fought a pitched battle on the grass. But, however well we
fought, we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe
Dillon’s war dance of victory. His parents went to eight-o’clock mass
every morning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs Dillon
was prevalent in the hall of the house. But he played too fiercely for
us who were younger and more timid. He looked like some kind of an
Indian when he capered round the garden, an old tea-cosy on his head,
beating a tin with his fist and yelling:

“Ya! yaka, yaka, yaka!”

Everyone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a vocation
for the priesthood. Nevertheless it was true.

A spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its
influence, differences of culture and constitution were waived. We
banded ourselves together, some boldly, some in jest and some almost in
fear: and of the number of these latter, the reluctant Indians who were
afraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness, I was one. The
adventures related in the literature of the Wild West were remote from
my nature but, at least, they opened doors of escape. I liked better
some American detective stories which were traversed from time to time
by unkempt fierce and beautiful girls. Though there was nothing wrong
in these stories and though their intention was sometimes literary they
were circulated secretly at school. One day when Father Butler was
hearing the four pages of Roman History clumsy Leo Dillon was
discovered with a copy of _The Halfpenny Marvel_.
t of
some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked
round for it, but it was gone.

“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’

“‘Yes, it was gone.’

“  ‘You cannot say what it was?’

“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’

“‘How far from the body?’

“‘A dozen yards or so.’

“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’

“‘About the same.’

“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of
it?’

“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’

“This concluded the examination of the witness.”

“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in his
concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls
attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having
signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details
of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his
father’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against
the son.”

Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the
cushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,”
said he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s
favour. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having
too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent
a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too
much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so
_outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the
vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of
view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither
that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and
not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of
action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty
minutes.”

It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the
beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found
ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,
ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the
platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings
which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no
difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove
to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.

“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.
“I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until
you had been on the scene of the crime.”

“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is
entirely a question of barometric pressure.”

Lestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.

“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the
sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the
sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do
not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”

Lestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your
conclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a
pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,
of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.
She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly
told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not
already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”

He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most
lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes
shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of
her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.

“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of
us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my
companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell
you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to
start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon
that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and
I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to
hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.”

“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You may
rely upon my doing all that I can.”

“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do
you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he
is innocent?”

“I think that it is very probable.”

“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly
at Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has
been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.

“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And
about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he
would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in
it.”

“In what way?” asked Holmes.

“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many
disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should
be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as
brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little
of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything
like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of
them.”

“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such a union?”

“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of
it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one
of his keen, questioning glances at her.

“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your father if I
call to-morrow?”

“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”

“The doctor?”

“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years
back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,
and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is
shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the
old days in Victoria.”

“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”

“Yes, at the mines.”

“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made
his money.”

“Yes, certainly.”

“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”

“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go
to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that
I know him to be innocent.”

“I will, Miss Turner.”

“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I
leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried
from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the
wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.

“I am ashamed of you, Holmes,” said Lestrade with dignity after a few
minutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to
disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”

“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,” said Holmes.
“Have you an order to see him in prison?”

“Yes, but only for you and me.”

“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still
time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?”

“Ample.”

“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but
I shall only be away a couple of hours.”

I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the
streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay
upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.
The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the
deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention
wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung
it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of
the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man’s story
were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely
unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the
time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by
his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and
deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal
something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the
weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.
In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of
the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon
my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.
That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen
quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go
for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the
blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to
it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could
that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow
does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an
attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I
cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the
incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true
the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and
to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back
turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and
improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s
opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I
could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen
his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.

It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for
Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.

“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down. “It is
of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the
ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest
for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by
a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.”

“And what did you learn from him?”

“Nothing.”

“Could he throw no light?”

“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had
done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is
as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,
though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”

“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that
he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss
Turner.”

“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,
insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a
lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at
a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of
a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a
word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him
to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do,
but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of
this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his
father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss
Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and
his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown
him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife
that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did
not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has
come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers
that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him
over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband
already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between
them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
that he has suffered.”

“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”

“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.
One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the
pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was
away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the
murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had
returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And
now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall
leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”

There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright
and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the
carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.

“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said
that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”

“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.

“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life
abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business
has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s,
and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he
gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”

“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.

“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about
here speaks of his kindness to him.”

“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this
McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been
under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son
to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and
that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a
proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we
know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us
as much. Do you not deduce something from that?”

“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade,
winking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without
flying away after theories and fancies.”

“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it very hard to
tackle the facts.”

“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to
get hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth.

“And that is—”

“That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all
theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”

“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing.
“But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the
left.”

“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,
two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon
the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,
gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay
heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’
request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his
death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had
then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight
different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from
which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.

Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as
this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker
Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and
darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his
eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was
bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins
stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed
to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so
absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or
remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a
quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way
along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the
woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that
district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and
amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes
would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little
detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective
indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the
interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions
was directed towards a definite end.

The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some
fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley
Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods
which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting
pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On
the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was
a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of
the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the
exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was
the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by
the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager
face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the
trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and
then turned upon my companion.

“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.

“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or
other trace. But how on earth—”

“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward
twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it
vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I
been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over
it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have
covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are
three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens and lay
down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time
rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice
he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply
marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran
when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father’s feet
as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the
gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?
Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,
they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they
come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the
track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the
shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes
traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained
there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what
seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens
not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could
reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he
carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the
wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.

“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning
to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must
be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and
perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our
luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”

It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into
Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up
in the wood.

“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “The
murder was done with it.”

“I see no marks.”

“There are none.”

“How do you know, then?”

“The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.
There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds
with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”

“And the murderer?”

“Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears
thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses
a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are
several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our
search.”

Lestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said.
“Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed
British jury.”

“_Nous verrons_,” answered Holmes calmly. “You work your own method,
and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall
probably return to London by the evening train.”

“And leave your case unfinished?”

“No, finished.”

“But the mystery?”

“It is solved.”

“Who was the criminal, then?”

“The gentleman I describe.”

“But who is he?”

“Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a
populous neighbourhood.”

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said, “and
I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a
left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the
laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.”

“All right,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given you the chance. Here
are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.”

Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we
found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought
with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a
perplexing position.

“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just sit down
in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don’t know quite
what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me
expound.”

 “Pray do so.”

“Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young
McCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they
impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that
his father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing
him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled
several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s
ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will
begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”

“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”

“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as
far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within
earshot. The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it
was that he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly
Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a
strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him
at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.”

“What of the rat, then?”

Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it
out on the table. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said.
“I wired to Bristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of
the map. “What do you read?”

“ARAT,” I read.

“And now?” He raised his hand.

“BALLARAT.”

“Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only
caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his
murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.”

“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.

“It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down
considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,
granting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have
come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an
Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.”

“Certainly.”

“And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be
approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly
wander.”

“Quite so.”

“Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I
gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as
to the personality of the criminal.”

“But how did you gain them?”

“You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.”

“His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his
stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.”

“Yes, they were peculiar boots.”

“But his lameness?”

“The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his
left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was lame.”

“But his left-handedness.”

“You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by
the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately
behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it
were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the
interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found
the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables
me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some
attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140
different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found
the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which
are rolled in Rotterdam.”

“And the cigar-holder?”

“I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used
a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not
a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.”

“Holmes,” I said, “you have drawn a net round this man from which he
cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if
you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in
which all this points. The culprit is—”

“Mr. John Turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our
sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.

The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,
limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,
and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs
showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of
character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping
eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his
appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the
corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear
to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic
disease.

“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my note?”

“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see
me here to avoid scandal.”

“I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.”

“And why did you wish to see me?” He looked across at my companion with
despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.

“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is
so. I know all about McCarthy.”

The old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I
would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that
I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”

“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely.

“I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would
break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am
arrested.”

“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.

“What?”

“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who
required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young
McCarthy must be got off, however.”

“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My
doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would
rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.”

Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a
bundle of paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall
jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it.
Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save
young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is
absolutely needed.”

“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live
to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare
Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has
been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.

“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I
tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.
His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my
life. I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.

“It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings. I was a young chap then,
hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got
among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to
the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway
robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,
sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the
road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,
and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.

“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay
in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us,
so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the
first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the
swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this
very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I
spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as
though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became
wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.
There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a
quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be
in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to
make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and
though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when
she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path
as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and
did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy
laid his grip upon me.

“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent
Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.

“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as
good as a family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can
have the keeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country
is England, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’

“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them
off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.
There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I
would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse
as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my
past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever
it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last
he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.

“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known
to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad
should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not
have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to
the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm.
McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at
the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.

“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a
cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I
listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come
uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little
regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the
streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear
should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the
bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind
and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my
memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that
foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I
have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that
my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if
he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;
but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back
to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true
story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”

“Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said Holmes as the old man
signed the statement which had been drawn out. “I pray that we may
never be exposed to such a temptation.”

“I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?”

“In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will
soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I
will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be
forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and
your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.”

“Farewell, then,” said the old man solemnly. “Your own deathbeds, when
they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you
have given to mine.” Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he
stumbled slowly from the room.

“God help us!” said Holmes after a long silence. “Why does fate play
such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as
this that I do not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but for
the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.’”

James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number
of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the
defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our
interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son
and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the
black cloud which rests upon their past.



V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS

When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases
between the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present
strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know
which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained
publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for
those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree,
and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too,
have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,
beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially
cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture
and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in
its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give
some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in
connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,
entirely cleared up.

The year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or
less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under
this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the
Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious
club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts
connected with the loss of the British barque _Sophy Anderson_, of the
singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and
finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be
remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s
watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction
which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these
I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such
singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have
now taken up my pen to describe.

It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had
set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the
rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of
great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the
instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those
great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his
civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the
storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a
child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the
fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was
deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until the howl of the
gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the
rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was
on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once
more in my old quarters at Baker Street.

“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell.
Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”

“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not encourage
visitors.”

“A client, then?”

“If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on
such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to
be some crony of the landlady’s.”

Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a
step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his
long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant
chair upon which a newcomer must sit.

“Come in!” said he.

The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,
well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy
in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and
his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he
had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I
could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a
man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.

“I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his
eyes. “I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some
traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.”

“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may rest here on
the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the
south-west, I see.”

“Yes, from Horsham.”

“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite
distinctive.”

“I have come for advice.”

“That is easily got.”

“And help.”

“That is not always so easy.”

“I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how
you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.”

“Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”

“He said that you could solve anything.”

“He said too much.”

“That you are never beaten.”

“I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a
woman.”

“But what is that compared with the number of your successes?”

“It is true that I have been generally successful.”

“Then you may be so with me.”

“I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with
some details as to your case.”

“It is no ordinary one.”

“None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.”

“And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have
ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events
than those which have happened in my own family.”

“You fill me with interest,” said Holmes. “Pray give us the essential
facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to
those details which seem to me to be most important.”

The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards
the blaze.

“My name,” said he, “is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far
as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a
hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must
go back to the commencement of the affair.

“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and my
father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he
enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee
of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such
success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome
competence.

“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became
a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At
the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under
Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my
uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four
years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small
estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune
in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the
negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the
franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered,
very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring
disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if
ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields
round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very
often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great
deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and
did not want any friends, not even his own brother.

“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time
when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be
in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He
begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in
his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and
draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the
servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was
sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could
go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him
in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a
single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably
locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to
enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I
was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and
bundles as would be expected in such a room.

“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon
the table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common thing
for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money,
and he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took it
up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out
there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon
his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my
lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were
protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope
which he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and
then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’

“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.

“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,
leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw
scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter
K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried
pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the
breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with
an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,
and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.

“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he
with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,
and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’

“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step
up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there
was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass
box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed,
with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had
read in the morning upon the envelope.

“‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave my
estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my
brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you
can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my
advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to
give you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are
going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’

“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.
The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression
upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind
without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off
the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation
grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the
usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however.
He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of
society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door
locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of
drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the
garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of
no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by
man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush
tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man
who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the
roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold
day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.

“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse
your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken
sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to
search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay
at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the
water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his
known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew
how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade
myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,
however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of
some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”

“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of
the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date
of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his
supposed suicide.”

“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,
upon the night of May 2nd.”

“Thank you. Pray proceed.”

“When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made
a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We
found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On
the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.
K. repeated upon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’
written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers
which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was
nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered
papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of
them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and
had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during
the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned
with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the
carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.

“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at
Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of
’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a
sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There
he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried
orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always
laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but
he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
himself.

“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he stammered.

“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.

“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the
very letters. But what is this written above them?’

“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over his shoulder.

“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.

“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the
papers must be those that are destroyed.’

“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilised
land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the
thing come from?’

“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.

“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with
sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’

“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.

“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’

“‘Then let me do so?’

“‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’

“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I
went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.

“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from
home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command
of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,
for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away
from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his
absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at
once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound
in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.
I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his
consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in
the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit
unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death
from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected
with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the
idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And
yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I
was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.

“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I
did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our
troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s
life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in
another.

“It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two years
and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived
happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed
away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I
had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow
fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.”

The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning
to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.

“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is London—eastern
division. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last
message: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”

“What have you done?” asked Holmes.

“Nothing.”

“Nothing?”

“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white hands—“I have
felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the
snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some
resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can
guard against.”

“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you are lost.
Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”

“I have seen the police.”

“Ah!”

“But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the
inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical
jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as
the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”

Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he
cried.

“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the
house with me.”

“Has he come with you to-night?”

“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”

Again Holmes raved in the air.

“Why did you come to me?” he said, “and, above all, why did you not
come at once?”

“I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast
about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”

“It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted
before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which
you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”

“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat
pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he
laid it out upon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that
on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,
unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular
colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am
inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,
fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped
destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us
much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The
writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”

Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which
showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It
was headed, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical
notices:

“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.

“7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St.
Augustine.

“9th. McCauley cleared.

“10th. John Swain cleared.

“12th. Visited Paramore. All well.”

“Thank you!” said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our
visitor. “And now you must on no account lose another instant. We
cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get
home instantly and act.”

“What shall I do?”

“There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put
this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which
you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the
other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one
which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry
conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box
out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?”

“Entirely.”

“Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think
that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to
weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to
remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear
up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.”

“I thank you,” said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.
“You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you
advise.”

“Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the
meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are
threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”

“By train from Waterloo.”

“It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you
may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”

“I am armed.”

“That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”

“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”

“No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.”

“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to
the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.”
He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still
screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This
strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad
elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to
have been reabsorbed by them once more.

Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk
forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit
his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings
as they chased each other up to the ceiling.

“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have
had none more fantastic than this.”

“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”

“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me
to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”

“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what
these perils are?”

“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.

“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this
unhappy family?”

Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of
his chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he
remarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its
bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up
to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier
could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a
single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in
a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other
ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which
the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of
their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is
necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts
which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you
will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these
days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare
accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should
possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,
and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly,
you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my
limits in a very precise fashion.”

“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular document. Philosophy,
astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany
variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region
within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,
sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,
swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I
think, were the main points of my analysis.”

Holmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said
then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all
the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in
the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.
Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us
to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me
down the letter K of the _American Encyclopædia_ which stands upon the
shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see
what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a
strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason
for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their
habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the
lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude
in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or
something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of
someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he
feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters
which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the
postmarks of those letters?”

“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third
from London.”

“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”

“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”

“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the
probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a
ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of
Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,
in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest
anything?”

“A greater distance to travel.”

“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”

“Then I do not see the point.”

“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or
men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their
singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.
You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from
Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have
arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven
weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the
difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the
sailing vessel which brought the writer.”

“It is possible.”

“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of
this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has
always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to
travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we
cannot count upon delay.”

“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”

“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to
the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite
clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not
have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s
jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men
of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the
holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be
the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.”

“But of what society?”

“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his
voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”

“I never have.”

Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here it is,”
said he presently:

“‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the
sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was
formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the
Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of
the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,
and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for
the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from
the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were
usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts,
melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim
might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the
country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon
him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was
the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that
there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving
it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to
the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite
of the efforts of the United States government and of the better
classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869,
the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been
sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’

“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume, “that the
sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance
of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause
and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the
more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this
register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,
and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is
recovered.”

“Then the page we have seen—”

“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the
pips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then
there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country,
and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.
Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place,
and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime
is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to
be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget
for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
ways of our fellow men.”

It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued
brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.
Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.

“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “I have, I
foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young
Openshaw’s.”

“What steps will you take?” I asked.

“It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may
have to go down to Horsham, after all.”

“You will not go there first?”

“No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid
will bring up your coffee.”

As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced
my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my
heart.

“Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late.”

“Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much. How was it
done?” He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.

“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near
Waterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account:

“‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H
Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a
splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy,
so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite
impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by
the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It
proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from
an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose
residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been
hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that
in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked
over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.
The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt
that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which
should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to
the condition of the riverside landing-stages.’”

We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken
than I had ever seen him.

“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last. “It is a petty feeling,
no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me
now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.
That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to
his death—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in
uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a
nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.

“They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed at last. “How could they
have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line
to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a
night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in
the long run. I am going out now!”

“To the police?”

“No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take
the flies, but not before.”

All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the
evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come
back yet. It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and
worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf
he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of
water.

“You are hungry,” I remarked.

“Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since
breakfast.”

“Nothing?”

“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”

“And how have you succeeded?”

“Well.”

“You have a clue?”

“I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long
remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark
upon them. It is well thought of!”

“What do you mean?”

He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he
squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust
them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J.
O.” Then he sealed it and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun,
Barque _Lone Star_, Savannah, Georgia.”

“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling. “It may
give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his
fate as Openshaw did before him.”

“And who is this Captain Calhoun?”

“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”

“How did you trace it, then?”

He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates
and names.

“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and
files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel
which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There were
thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those
months. Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my
attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from
London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the
Union.”

“Texas, I think.”

“I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an
American origin.”

“What then?”

“I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque _Lone
Star_ was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I
then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of
London.”

“Yes?”

“The _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert
Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide
this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and
learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly
I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from
the Isle of Wight.”

“What will you do, then?”

“Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the
only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and
Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last
night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By
the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will
have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police
of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a
charge of murder.”

There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the
murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which
would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves,
was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial
gales that year. We waited long for news of the _Lone Star_ of
Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere
far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen
swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters “L. S.” carved upon
it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _Lone
Star_.



VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP

Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the
Theological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The
habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he
was at college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams
and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt
to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that
the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years
he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and
pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow,
pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a
chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.

One night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the
hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up
in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made
a little face of disappointment.

“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”

I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.

We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon
the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some
dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.

“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly
losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my
wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such trouble!”
she cried; “I do so want a little help.”

“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate Whitney. How you
startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”

“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always
the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a
lighthouse.

“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and
water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you
rather that I sent James off to bed?”

“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa.
He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!”

It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s
trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school
companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.
Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring
him back to her?

It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he
had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest
east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one
day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But
now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay
there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison
or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of
it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do?
How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place
and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?

There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.
Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,
why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as
such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were
alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab
within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given
me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery
sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a
strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only
could show how strange it was to be.

But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.
Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves
which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.
Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of
steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the
den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down
the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken
feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found
the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with
the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
forecastle of an emigrant ship.

Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in
strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown
back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark,
lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows
there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as
the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The
most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked
together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming
in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling
out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his
neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal,
beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old
man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his
knees, staring into the fire.

As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for
me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.

“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of
mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”

There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering
through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring
out at me.

“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction,
with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”

“Nearly eleven.”

“Of what day?”

“Of Friday, June 19th.”

“Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you
want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms and began
to sob in a high treble key.

“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two
days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”

“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few
hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with
you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have
you a cab?”

“Yes, I have one waiting.”

“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,
Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”

I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,
holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,
and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by
the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice
whispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.” The words fell
quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come
from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,
very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down
from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude
from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all
my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I.
His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had
regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my
surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion
to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round
to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped
senility.

“Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this den?”

“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If you would
have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I
should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”

“I have a cab outside.”

“Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he
appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you
also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have
thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with
you in five minutes.”

It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests, for they
were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet
air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in
the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I
could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in
one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his
existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney’s bill,
led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a
very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I
was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he
shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing
quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit
of laughter.

“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have added
opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.”

“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”

“But not more so than I to find you.”

“I came to find a friend.”

“And I to find an enemy.”

“An enemy?”

“Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.
Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I
have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as
I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would
not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now
for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to
have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that
building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some
strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.”

“What! You do not mean bodies?”

“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every
poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest
murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair
has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.” He
put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal
which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed
shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.

“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the
gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side
lanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”

“If I can be of use.”

“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.
My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”

“The Cedars?”

“Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct
the inquiry.”

“Where is it, then?”

“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”

“But I am all in the dark.”

“Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.
All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out
for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”

He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the
endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened
gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with
the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull
wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,
regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some
belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the
sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts
of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside
him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax
his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of
his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to
the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,
shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who
has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.

“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes you
quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great thing for
me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not
over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little
woman to-night when she meets me at the door.”

“You forget that I know nothing about it.”

“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get
to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to
go upon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of
it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you,
Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”

“Proceed, then.”

“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a
gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of
money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and
lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the
neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer,
by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was
interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the
morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St.
Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a
good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with
all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,
as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10_s_., while
he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.
There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been
weighing upon his mind.

“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than
usual, remarking before he started that he had two important
commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a
box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram
as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10_s_., while
